# Module: [Ability]

Scope: The eight ability scores (Strength, Stamina, Agility, Dexterity, Fighting, Intellect, Awareness, Presence), absent abilities, debilitated abilities, and derived defense values.

# Core Domain

### **ability**
- One of eight fundamental numeric traits that characterize a hero's physical or mental capabilities.
- Partitioned into physical abilities (STR, STA, AGL, DEX) and mental abilities (FGT, INT, AWE, PRE).
- Each above-average ability rank provides a bonus on related die rolls; below-average rank applies a penalty.
- The ability rank is added to (or subtracted from) die rolls for tasks related to that ability and to calculate derived values.
- Ability ranks can be bought up using power points, reduced below 0 for bonus power points, or altered by power effects during play.
- Some ability ranks — or portions of them — can be designated as Enhanced Traits (powers), which behave differently from natural ranks.

### **ability rank**
- Numeric value expressing the degree of an ability; starts at 0 (the baseline average for an adult human).
- Can go as low as −5 (truly terrible) and as high as 20 or beyond for cosmic beings and forces.
- Costs 2 power points per +1 rank when purchased; yields 2 bonus power points per −1 rank when reduced.
- Cannot be voluntarily lowered below −5; dropping below −5 due to an external effect triggers the debilitated state.
- Used directly as a modifier on die rolls and as the base for calculating derived defense values.

### **absent ability**
- A creature entirely lacking an ability has no rank for it, a state distinct from having rank −5.
- Automatically fails any check requiring the absent ability.
- Lacking an ability grants an additional 10 power points to spend elsewhere — more generous than the −5 floor.
- Heroes cannot lack an ability without Gamemaster permission, as absence has significant game effects.
- An absent ability cannot be weakened or debilitated — it simply is not present.
- Per-ability absence effects:
  - No Strength: incapable of exerting any physical force (incorporeal or immobile creature).
  - No Stamina: no physical body; suffers and recovers from damage as an inanimate object; immune to fatigue; no Fortitude defense.
  - No Dexterity: cannot manipulate objects; cannot make physical attacks.
  - No Agility: unable to move under own power; no Dodge defense.
  - No Fighting: incapable of any close attack.
  - No Intellect: automaton; immune to mental effects and interaction skills; no Will defense.
  - No Awareness: completely unaware; also has no Presence; immune to mental effects and interaction skills; treated as inanimate object.
  - No Presence: unable to interact; immune to interaction skills; no Will defense.

### **Strength (STR)**
- Measures sheer muscle power and the ability to apply physical force.
- Applies to: unarmed and strength-based attack damage; jump distance (Athletics check); weight lifting, carrying, and throwing; Athletics skill checks.
- Physical ability.

### **Stamina (STA)**
- Measures health, endurance, and overall physical resilience.
- Applies to: Toughness defense (resisting damage); Fortitude defense (resisting effects on health); Stamina checks for health-related resistance and recovery when no specific defense applies.
- Physical ability.

### **Agility (AGL)**
- Measures balance, grace, speed, and overall physical coordination.
- Applies to: Dodge defense (avoiding ranged attacks and hazards); initiative bonus (acting first in combat); Acrobatics and Stealth skill checks; Agility checks for coordination feats.
- Physical ability.

### **Dexterity (DEX)**
- Measures hand-eye coordination, precision, and manual dexterity.
- Applies to: ranged attack checks; Sleight of Hand and Vehicles skill checks; Dexterity checks for fine control and precision tasks.
- Physical ability.

### **Fighting (FGT)**
- Measures close combat ability — hitting targets and evading counter-attacks in melee.
- Applies to: close attack checks; Parry defense (avoiding close attacks).
- Mental ability (grouped with INT, AWE, PRE as a mental ability in the core rules).

### **Intellect (INT)**
- Covers reasoning ability and learning; a high rank correlates with knowledge and education.
- Applies to: Expertise, Investigation, Technology, and Treatment skill checks; Intellect checks for pure reasoning when no specific skill applies.
- Mental ability.

### **Awareness (AWE)**
- Covers common sense and intuition ("wisdom"), distinct from Intellect (reasoning).
- Applies to: Will defense (resisting mental attacks); Insight and Perception skill checks; Awareness checks for intuition when no specific skill applies.
- Mental ability.
- A creature with no Awareness is also treated as having no Presence; awareness and presence absence are linked.

### **Presence (PRE)**
- Measures force of personality, persuasiveness, leadership ability, and attractiveness.
- Applies to: Deception, Intimidation, and Persuasion skill checks; Presence checks to influence others through force of personality.
- Mental ability.

### **Dodge**
- Defense value based on Agility rank; covers reaction time, quickness, nimbleness, and coordination.
- Used to avoid ranged attacks and other hazards where reflexes and speed are important.
- Active defense: requires mobility and focus; halved (round up) when vulnerable; reduced to 0 when defenseless.
- Used as defense class (Dodge + 10) against ranged attacks.
- Used in Dodge resistance checks (e.g., reflexively avoid a triggered trap).
- Can be increased above the Agility base by spending 1 power point per rank, subject to power level limits.

### **Parry**
- Defense value based on Fighting rank; represents countering, ducking, or evading close attacks.
- Active defense: halved (round up) when vulnerable; reduced to 0 when defenseless.
- Used as defense class (Parry + 10) for close attacks.
- Can be increased above the Fighting base by spending 1 power point per rank, subject to power level limits.

### **Fortitude**
- Defense value based on Stamina rank; measures health and resistance to threats like poison or disease.
- Incorporates constitution, ruggedness, metabolism, and immunity.
- Passive defense: always effective regardless of mobility restrictions.
- Used in Fortitude resistance checks against health-affecting effects (toxins, disease, dying).
- Can be increased above the Stamina base by spending 1 power point per rank.
- Creatures with no Stamina have no Fortitude defense.

### **Toughness**
- Defense value based on Stamina rank; measures resistance to direct damage and overall physical durability.
- Cannot be increased above the base Stamina rank by direct power point spending — only through advantages (e.g., Defensive Roll) and powers (e.g., Protection effect).
- This restriction reflects that greater-than-normal Toughness is virtually always a special ability.
- Used in Toughness resistance checks against damage.

### **Will**
- Defense value based on Awareness rank; measures mental stability, level-headedness, determination, self-confidence, and willpower.
- Used to resist mental or spiritual attacks.
- Used as defense class (Will + 10) when an attack targets Will.
- Can be increased above the Awareness base by spending 1 power point per rank.
- Creatures with no Intellect or no Awareness/Presence have no Will defense.

### **defense**
- General term for the five defensive values (Dodge, Parry, Fortitude, Toughness, Will) used to resist or avoid effects.
- Each defense is based on a specific ability rank, modified by advantages and powers.
- Base defense rank equals the rank of the associated ability.
- Can be increased above base by spending 1 power point per rank, subject to power level limits (except Toughness).
- Serves two purposes: (1) defense class (defense + 10 = DC to affect a target with an attack); (2) resistance check (defense + d20 vs effect's DC).
- Active defenses (Dodge, Parry) require mobility and focus to be fully effective; passive defenses (Fortitude, Toughness, Will) are unaffected by mobility.

### **debilitated**
- State reached when an ability rank drops below −5 for any reason (typically caused by a power effect).
- Ability ranks cannot be lowered any further once debilitated; this threshold is the floor for each ability.
- Per-ability debilitation effects:
  - STR, AGL, or DEX debilitated: hero collapses — defenseless, immobilized, and stunned (but still conscious and aware).
  - STA debilitated: hero is dying, with an additional −5 modifier on Fortitude checks to avoid death.
  - FGT debilitated: hero is dazed and defenseless; cannot make close attacks.
  - INT, AWE, or PRE debilitated: hero is unaware and remains so until the ability is restored to at least −5.

### **enhanced ability**

*(Found term — discovered in source material; not in original Core terms list.)*

- An ability rank (or portion thereof) acquired as an Enhanced Trait (power) rather than as a natural rank.
- Can be nullified by the Nullify effect — normal (natural) ability ranks cannot be nullified.
- Can have power modifiers and be used for power stunts with extra effort — normal ranks cannot.
- Same cost as normal ability ranks: 2 power points per +1 rank.
- The player decides whether a rank is normal, enhanced, or a combination; both apply as modifier simultaneously.

### **initiative**

*(Found term — discovered in source material; not in original Core terms list.)*

- Derived combat-readiness value computed as: Agility rank + Advantages (Improved Initiative) + Power Modifiers.
- Determines action order at the start of a conflict: characters act from highest to lowest initiative modifier.
- Defined in Ch3 Abilities alongside the five defenses, grounding it in the ability module.
- Depends on the Agility ability rank for its base value; the Advantage and Power components are boundary contributions.

### **active defense**

*(Found term — discovered in source material; not in original Core terms list.)*

- Category of defense that requires mobility, focus, and reaction time to be fully effective.
- Comprises Dodge and Parry — the two ability-derived defenses that degrade under condition effects.
- When vulnerable: active defense ranks are halved (divide normal value by 2, round up).
- When defenseless: active defense ranks are reduced to 0.
- Contrasts with passive defenses (Fortitude, Toughness, Will), which are unaffected by mobility restrictions.

### **defense class**

*(Found term — discovered in source material; not in original Core terms list.)*

- The difficulty class for a given attack to affect a target: defense rank + 10.
- Represents the target's "routine defense" (equivalent to a routine check).
- Primary defense class traits: Dodge (for ranged attacks), Parry (for close attacks), and Will (for mental attacks).
- An attack "targets" a defense when it uses that defense's class as its DC.
