## Story: `Roll Initiative Check`

**Story type:** system

### Domain terms

- *Initiative Check* — d20 + initiative modifier rolled by each character at conflict start to establish sequence
- *Initiative Modifier* — character's Agility rank plus any advantage or power bonuses (e.g., Improved Initiative)
- *Conflict* — structured encounter governed by turn order and action economy
- *Action Round* — six-second unit of in-game time; the cycle that repeats until the conflict ends
- *Initiative Order* — descending list of participants from highest roll to lowest

### Acceptance criteria

1. **WHEN** a *Conflict* begins  
   **THEN** the system prompts each participant to roll an *Initiative Check* (d20 + *Initiative Modifier*)  
   **AND** each result is recorded against the corresponding character  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_196.md` — Ch8 "Initiative", lines 14083–14127

2. **WHEN** a character has an advantage or power that modifies initiative (e.g., Improved Initiative)  
   **THEN** the system includes that bonus in the character's *Initiative Modifier* before the roll is made  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_196.md` — Ch8 "Initiative", lines 14083–14127

3. **WHEN** two or more characters produce the same *Initiative Check* result  
   **THEN** the system flags the tie for resolution before finalizing position  
   **BUT** does not assign a turn slot until the tie-breaking sequence completes  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_196.md` — Ch8 "Initiative", lines 14083–14127

4. **WHEN** all *Initiative Checks* have been rolled  
   **THEN** the system arranges all participants in descending order to produce the *Initiative Order*  
   **AND** the first *Action Round* begins with the participant holding the highest position  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_196.md` — Ch8 "Initiative", lines 14083–14127

5. **WHEN** all participants complete their turns in the *Initiative Order*  
   **THEN** the system starts a new *Action Round* using the same *Initiative Order*  
   **BUT** does not re-roll initiative; the established sequence persists for the entire conflict  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_196.md` — Ch8 "Initiative", lines 14083–14127

### Acceptance criteria

1. **WHEN** all *Initiative Checks* are resolved  
   **THEN** the system sorts all participants from highest result to lowest to form the *Initiative Order*  
   **AND** each participant receives a *Turn Slot* at their roll's position  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_196.md` — Ch8 "Initiative", lines 14083–14127

2. **WHEN** a character's *Initiative Check* result is the highest in the conflict  
   **THEN** that character holds the first *Turn Slot* and acts before all others  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_196.md` — Ch8 "Initiative", lines 14083–14127

3. **WHEN** the *Initiative Order* is established  
   **THEN** the system displays or tracks the order so players and GM can follow along  
   **AND** each participant knows whose *Turn Slot* follows their own  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_196.md` — Ch8 "Initiative", lines 14083–14127

4. **WHEN** a participant's *Turn Slot* changes due to delay or a readied action  
   **THEN** the system updates that participant's position in the *Initiative Order*  
   **BUT** does not shift other participants' *Turn Slots*  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_211.md` — Ch8 "Delay", lines 14871–14914; `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_213.md` — Ch8 "Ready", lines 14959–14998

### Acceptance criteria

1. **WHEN** the *Player* declares a *Ranged Attack* against a target within the long *Range Band*  
   **THEN** the system computes the target's *Dodge*-based *Defense Class* (Dodge rank + 10)  
   **AND** the player rolls d20 + *Attack Bonus* adjusted for *Range Band*; equaling or exceeding is a hit

### Acceptance criteria

1. **WHEN** the target is in the medium *Range Band* (rank × 25 ft to rank × 50 ft)  
   **THEN** the system applies a −2 *Circumstance Modifier* to the *Attack Bonus*  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_016.md` — Ch1 "Attack Checks", lines 1195–1237

2. **WHEN** the target is in the long *Range Band* (rank × 50 ft to rank × 100 ft)

## Story: `Resolve Attack Check Against Defense Class`

**Story type:** system

### Domain terms

- *Attack Check* — d20 + *Attack Bonus* (all modifiers applied); the resolution roll
- *Defense Class* — the difficulty number (active defense rank + 10); threshold for a hit
- *Hit* — result where *Attack Check* equals or exceeds *Defense Class*
- *Miss* — result where *Attack Check* falls below *Defense Class* (and die is not a natural 1 or 20)

### Acceptance criteria

1. **WHEN** an *Attack Check* is rolled  
   **THEN** the system compares the total (d20 + all modifiers) against the target's *Defense Class*  
   **AND** an equal or exceeding result registers as a *Hit*  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_016.md` — Ch1 "Attack Checks", lines 1195–1237; `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_202.md` — Ch8 "Attacks", lines 14386–14434

2. **WHEN** the *Attack Check* total is below the *Defense Class* (and no natural extremes apply)  
   **THEN** the system records a *Miss* and no further damage or effect resolution occurs  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_016.md` — Ch1 "Attack Checks", lines 1195–1237

3. **WHEN** a *Hit* is scored

## Story: `Register Natural 1 as Automatic Miss`

**Story type:** system

### Domain terms

- *Natural 1* — a d20 roll result of exactly 1 before any modifier is added
- *Automatic Miss* — the rule that a *Natural 1* always fails regardless of *Attack Bonus* or *Defense Class*

### Acceptance criteria

1. **WHEN** the d20 roll for an *Attack Check* shows a *Natural 1*  
   **THEN** the system registers an *Automatic Miss* without comparing the total to the *Defense Class*  
   **AND** no damage or condition is applied to the target  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_016.md` — Ch1 "Attack Checks", lines 1195–1237; `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_203.md` — Ch8 "Critical Misses", lines 14435–14489

2. **WHEN** the *Automatic Miss* fires  
   **THEN** any aim bonus, maneuver bonus, or other circumstance modifier is irrelevant — the total is not computed  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_203.md` — Ch8 "Critical Misses", lines 14435–14489

3. **WHEN** the *Natural 1* occurs for an area or perception-range effect  
   **THEN** the *Automatic Miss* rule does not apply because those effects bypass the attack check  
   **BUT** a natural 1 on a non-attack check (resistance check, skill check) is not automatically anything for those effects  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_016.md` — Ch1 "Attack Checks", lines 1195–1237

4. **WHEN** the *Automatic Miss* is registered

## Story: `Detect Natural 20 as Potential Critical Hit`

**Story type:** system

### Domain terms

- *Natural 20* — a d20 roll result of exactly 20 before any modifier is added
- *Automatic Hit* — the guarantee that a *Natural 20* hits regardless of the target's *Defense Class*
- *Threat* — the state after a *Natural 20*; hit is confirmed but critical status is pending
- *Critical Hit Confirmation* — the second step: comparing the full *Attack Check* total to *Defense Class*

### Acceptance criteria

1. **WHEN** the d20 roll for an *Attack Check* shows a *Natural 20*  
   **THEN** the system registers an *Automatic Hit* regardless of the target's *Defense Class*  
   **AND** flags the result as a *Threat* requiring *Critical Hit Confirmation*  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_203.md` — Ch8 "Critical Hits", lines 14435–14489

2. **WHEN** a *Threat* is registered  
   **THEN** the system computes the full *Attack Check* total (d20 result + all modifiers)  
   **AND** compares it to the target's *Defense Class* to confirm or deny a critical hit  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_203.md` — Ch8 "Critical Hits", lines 14435–14489

3. **WHEN** a *Natural 20* occurs for an area or perception-range effect  
   **THEN** no *Threat* or critical determination is made; those effects cannot score critical hits  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_016.md` — Ch1 "Attack Checks", lines 1195–1237

4. **WHEN** a character has the Improved Critical advantage  
   **THEN** the threat range for that specific attack type extends below 20  
   **AND** any die result in that extended range also triggers *Critical Hit Confirmation*  
   **BUT** only a *Natural 20* guarantees an *Automatic Hit*; extended range results still need to beat *Defense Class* to hit

## Story: `Determine Critical Hit When Total Meets Defense`

**Story type:** system

### Domain terms

- *Critical Hit* — a confirmed special hit requiring *Natural 20* AND full total ≥ *Defense Class*
- *Critical Hit Confirmation* — comparing full *Attack Check* total to *Defense Class* after a *Threat*
- *Normal Hit* — a *Natural 20* whose total fails to equal or exceed *Defense Class*; still a hit, but no critical effects

### Acceptance criteria

1. **WHEN** a *Threat* is evaluated for *Critical Hit Confirmation*  
   **THEN** the system compares the full *Attack Check* total (20 + modifiers) to the target's *Defense Class*  
   **AND** a total equal to or exceeding *Defense Class* confirms a *Critical Hit*  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_203.md` — Ch8 "Critical Hits", lines 14435–14489

2. **WHEN** the full *Attack Check* total falls below the *Defense Class*  
   **THEN** the result is a *Normal Hit* — a hit occurs, but no critical effect is granted  
   **AND** the attack proceeds to standard damage resolution  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_203.md` — Ch8 "Critical Hits", lines 14435–14489

3. **WHEN** the *Critical Hit* is confirmed  
   **THEN** the attacker chooses one of three *Critical Hit* effects before damage resolution  
   **AND** the system confirms the choice is applied exclusively (the options are mutually exclusive)  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_203.md` — Ch8 "Critical Hits", lines 14435–14489

4. **WHEN** the target is a minion and a *Critical Hit* is confirmed  
   **THEN** the Increased Effect option automatically bypasses the minion's resistance check  
   **AND** the minion suffers the worst degree of failure regardless of their defenses

## Story: `Apply Critical Hit Effect Choice`

**Story type:** user

### Domain terms

- *Increased Effect* — critical option: +5 to the resistance DC; against a *Minion*, bypasses resistance check entirely
- *Added Effect* — critical option: adds a bonus rank-0 secondary effect to the attack
- *Alternate Effect* — critical option: temporarily uses an alternate effect of the attack, at no fatigue cost
- *Critical Choice* — the mutually exclusive selection made by the attacker after a confirmed critical hit
- *Minion* — a character subject to defeat on any resistance failure; *Increased Effect* insta-defeats them

### Acceptance criteria

1. **WHEN** the *Player* selects *Increased Effect* after confirming a *Critical Hit*  
   **THEN** the system adds +5 to the effect's resistance DC for this attack  
   **AND** the target must make a Toughness check against the elevated DC  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_203.md` — Ch8 "Critical Hits", lines 14435–14489

2. **WHEN** the *Player* selects *Increased Effect* against a *Minion* target  
   **THEN** the system bypasses the resistance check entirely  
   **AND** the *Minion* automatically receives the worst degree of failure  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_203.md` — Ch8 "Critical Hits", lines 14435–14489

3. **WHEN** the *Player* selects *Added Effect*  
   **THEN** the system applies a bonus rank-0 secondary effect on top of the attack's normal effect  
   **AND** the target must resist both the primary effect and the rank-0 secondary effect  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_203.md` — Ch8 "Critical Hits", lines 14435–14489

4. **WHEN** the *Player* selects *Alternate Effect*  
   **THEN** the attack functions as a temporary alternate effect of the attacker's power, at no fatigue cost  
   **AND** the attacker does not accumulate the extra effort fatigue normally associated with a power stunt  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_203.md` — Ch8 "Critical Hits", lines 14435–14489

5. **WHEN** the *Critical Choice* is made  
   **THEN** only one of the three options applies; the attacker cannot combine them on the same attack  
   **BUT** the base hit effect still resolves normally in addition to the chosen critical effect  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_203.md` — Ch8 "Critical Hits", lines 14435–14489

6. **WHEN** the attack is an area or perception-range effect  
   **THEN** no *Critical Choice* is offered; these attack types cannot produce critical hits

- *Perception Effect* — an attack at perception range; automatically hits without an attack roll
- *Attack Check Bypass* — the rule that area and perception effects auto-hit and cannot crit or miss
- *Dodge Resistance Check* — the affected target's resistance roll against area effects (may be modified by cover)

### Acceptance criteria

1. **WHEN** an *Area Effect* is declared  
   **THEN** the system skips the *Attack Check* and applies the effect to all targets in the designated area  
   **AND** each target in the area makes their own resistance check against the effect  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_016.md` — Ch1 "Attack Checks", lines 1195–1237

2. **WHEN** a *Perception Effect* is declared  
   **THEN** the system skips the *Attack Check* and automatically hits the target  
   **AND** the target must make their resistance check against the effect's rank  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_016.md` — Ch1 "Attack Checks", lines 1195–1237

3. **WHEN** an *Area Effect* or *Perception Effect* is applied  
   **THEN** concealment penalties, cover penalties, aim bonuses, and maneuver modifiers have no effect on the hit  
   **AND** the system does not compute or apply any *Attack Bonus* or *Defense Class* comparison  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_016.md` — Ch1 "Attack Checks", lines 1195–1237

4. **WHEN** an *Area Effect* targets characters behind cover  
   **THEN** those characters gain a *Dodge Resistance Check* bonus equal to the cover penalty (partial = +2, total = +5)  
   **AND** this bonus applies only when the cover is between the target and the effect's origin  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_208.md` — Ch8 "Cover", lines 14738–14790

5. **WHEN** a natural 20 or natural 1 occurs on a resistance check against area/perception effects  
   **THEN** neither produces a critical hit nor an automatic miss for the attacker  
   **BUT** the natural roll still applies normal check success/failure rules for the resisting character

## Story: `Defend Against Incoming Attacks`

**Story type:** user

### Domain terms

- *Defend* — a standard action replacing attack with an active defense roll that supersedes *Defense Class*
- *Active Defense Roll* — an opposed check of Parry or Dodge against each incoming attack until next turn
- *Defense Floor* — any *Active Defense Roll* of 10 or lower is treated as 10, guaranteeing a minimum result of 11
- *Opposed Result* — the attacker must equal or exceed the *Active Defense Roll* result, not merely the base *Defense Class*

### Acceptance criteria

1. **WHEN** the *Player* declares *Defend* as their standard action  
   **THEN** the character makes an *Active Defense Roll* (Parry or Dodge) against every attack directed at them until the start of their next turn  
   **AND** the attacker must equal or exceed the *Active Defense Roll* result to hit  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_211.md` — Ch8 "Defend", lines 14871–14914

2. **WHEN** the *Active Defense Roll* result is 10 or lower  
   **THEN** the system treats it as 10 (*Defense Floor* applies)  
   **AND** the effective minimum opposed result is 11  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_211.md` — Ch8 "Defend", lines 14871–14914

3. **WHEN** an attacker's roll equals or exceeds the *Opposed Result*  
   **THEN** the attack hits and damage resolution proceeds normally  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_211.md` — Ch8 "Defend", lines 14871–14914

4. **WHEN** an attacker's roll fails to reach the *Opposed Result*  
   **THEN** the attack misses, even if it would have exceeded the static *Defense Class*  
   **BUT** the attack still consumes the attacker's *Standard Action*  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_211.md` — Ch8 "Defend", lines 14871–14914

5. **WHEN** the start of the defending character's next turn arrives  
   **THEN** the *Defend* effect ends and all subsequent attacks compare against the normal static *Defense Class*

- *Resistance Check* — the target's Strength or Dodge check (better of the two) after the grab lands
- *Grab Effect Rank* — the rank of a grabbing power effect, used in place of Strength if higher

### Acceptance criteria

1. **WHEN** the *Player* declares a *Grab*  
   **THEN** the system resolves a *Grab Attack Check* as a close attack against the target's Parry  
   **AND** on a hit, immediately triggers the *Resistance Check* for the target  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_212.md` — Ch8 "Grab", lines 14915–14958

2. **WHEN** the *Grab Attack Check* misses  
   **THEN** no *Resistance Check* is made and the grab attempt fails entirely  
   **AND** the attacker's *Standard Action* is consumed  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_212.md` — Ch8 "Grab", lines 14915–14958

3. **WHEN** the *Grab Attack Check* hits  
   **THEN** the target resists using the better of their Strength or Dodge against the attacker's Strength or *Grab Effect Rank*  
   **AND** the degree of the resistance result determines the hold outcome  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_212.md` — Ch8 "Grab", lines 14915–14958

4. **WHEN** the attacker wins the resistance check by one degree  
   **THEN** the target becomes *Restrained* (immobile and vulnerable)  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_212.md` — Ch8 "Grab", lines 14915–14958

- *Restrained* — one-degree hold: target is immobile and vulnerable
- *Bound* — two-or-more-degree hold: target is defenseless, immobile, and impaired
- *Attacker's Grab Rank* — the higher of the attacker's Strength rank or grab power effect rank

### Acceptance criteria

1. **WHEN** the *Grab Attack Check* hits  
   **THEN** the system runs the *Grab Resistance Check*: target rolls d20 + better of Strength or Dodge vs. *Attacker's Grab Rank* + 10  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_212.md` — Ch8 "Grab", lines 14915–14958

2. **WHEN** the target succeeds on the *Grab Resistance Check*  
   **THEN** the grab fails and the target is not *Restrained* or *Bound*  
   **BUT** the attacker's *Standard Action* is consumed and the attacker takes the hindered+vulnerable cost for the attempt  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_212.md` — Ch8 "Grab", lines 14915–14958

3. **WHEN** the attacker wins by exactly one degree  
   **THEN** the system imposes the *Restrained* condition on the target

   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_212.md` — Ch8 "Grab", lines 14915–14958

5. **WHEN** the attacker attempts to improve an existing hold on a subsequent turn  
   **THEN** a new *Grab Attack Check* and *Grab Resistance Check* are made  
   **AND** cumulative degrees from additional successes can upgrade *Restrained* to *Bound*  
   **BUT** if the attacker loses this new check, the target is freed entirely  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_212.md` — Ch8 "Grab", lines 14915–14958

## Story: `Maintain Grab Hold as Free Action`

**Story type:** user

### Domain terms

- *Maintain Grab* — a free action each turn to keep the grab hold in effect
- *Attacker Cost* — the *Hindered* and *Vulnerable* conditions applied to the attacker while holding
- *Hold Release* — the automatic freeing of the target if the attacker fails to maintain on their turn

### Acceptance criteria

1. **WHEN** the attacker holds a *Restrained* or *Bound* target  
   **THEN** the player must declare *Maintain Grab* as a free action each turn to keep the hold  
   **AND** the attacker remains *Hindered* and *Vulnerable* during each turn the hold is maintained  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_212.md` — Ch8 "Grab", lines 14915–14958

2. **WHEN** the attacker declares *Maintain Grab*  
   **THEN** the free action does not consume the *Standard Action* or *Move Action* budget  
   **AND** the attacker may still take a standard action and move action on that turn  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_212.md` — Ch8 "Grab", lines 14915–14958

3. **WHEN** the attacker's turn begins and no *Maintain Grab* free action is declared  
   **THEN** the hold releases and the target's *Restrained* or *Bound* condition ends  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_212.md` — Ch8 "Grab", lines 14915–14958

4. **WHEN** the attacker is forced to use their free action for another purpose and cannot maintain  
   **THEN** the hold releases automatically  
   **BUT** the attacker's other actions are unaffected

## Story: `Damage Grabbed Target on Subsequent Turn`

**Story type:** user

### Domain terms

- *Grab Damage* — Strength damage applied to a grabbed target as a standard action on turns after the grab is established
- *Subsequent Turn Requirement* — grab damage can only be dealt after the grab hold is already established from a prior turn
- *Same-Turn Restriction* — the attacker cannot both establish a grab and deal grab damage in the same turn

### Acceptance criteria

1. **WHEN** the attacker has an established *Restrained* or *Bound* hold from a prior turn  
   **THEN** the player may declare a *Grab Damage* standard action to deal Strength damage to the grabbed target  
   **AND** the target must make a Toughness resistance check against the attacker's Strength rank + 15  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_212.md` — Ch8 "Grab", lines 14915–14958

2. **WHEN** the *Grab Damage* standard action is taken

   **AND** the attacker remains *Hindered* and *Vulnerable*  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_212.md` — Ch8 "Grab", lines 14915–14958

3. **WHEN** the player attempts to deal *Grab Damage* on the same turn they established the grab  
   **THEN** the system blocks this; the grab must be established first before damage can be applied  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_212.md` — Ch8 "Grab", lines 14915–14958

4. **WHEN** the grabbed target escapes or the hold releases before the attacker's turn

- *Drag Resistance Check* — the target's Strength check vs. attacker's Strength to resist being moved
- *Drag Success* — target fails resistance; moves with attacker when attacker moves
- *Drag Failure* — target succeeds; remains in place

### Acceptance criteria

1. **WHEN** the attacker holds a *Restrained* or *Bound* target and declares movement  
   **THEN** the system triggers a *Drag Resistance Check*: target rolls Strength vs. attacker's Strength  
   **AND** on attacker winning, the target moves with the attacker during that movement  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_212.md` — Ch8 "Grab", lines 14915–14958

2. **WHEN** the target wins the *Drag Resistance Check*  
   **THEN** the target does not move with the attacker  
   **AND** the attacker may still move but the hold remains (target is left behind in their current position)  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_212.md` — Ch8 "Grab", lines 14915–14958

3. **WHEN** dragging succeeds  
   **THEN** the target ends the move in an adjacent location to the attacker  
   **AND** the *Restrained* or *Bound* condition persists through the drag  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_212.md` — Ch8 "Grab", lines 14915–14958

4. **WHEN** the attacker does not have a current hold (already released or escaped)  
   **THEN** the system blocks drag; a hold must be active to attempt dragging

## Story: `Escape from Grab`

**Story type:** user

### Domain terms

- *Escape* — a move action used by a grabbed target to attempt to break free
- *Escape Check* — the grabbed character's Athletics or Acrobatics vs. the attacker's routine Strength check
- *Routine Check Result* — the attacker's result for escape opposition: 10 + Strength modifier (no die roll)
- *Grab Release* — the outcome when the *Escape Check* succeeds; target is freed

### Acceptance criteria

1. **WHEN** the *Player* of a grabbed character declares *Escape* as their move action  
   **THEN** the system runs the *Escape Check*: target rolls Athletics or Acrobatics vs. attacker's routine Strength  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_212.md` — Ch8 "Grab", lines 14915–14958

2. **WHEN** the *Escape Check* succeeds  
   **THEN** the *Grab Release* occurs and the target's *Restrained* or *Bound* condition ends immediately  
   **AND** the target is free to act normally on subsequent turns  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_212.md` — Ch8 "Grab", lines 14915–14958

3. **WHEN** the *Escape Check* fails  
   **THEN** the hold remains and the *Restrained* or *Bound* condition persists  
   **AND** the move action is consumed without benefit  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_212.md` — Ch8 "Grab", lines 14915–14958

4. **WHEN** the grabbed target is *Bound* (two or more degrees)  
   **THEN** the *Escape Check* is still the same move action, but the opposition is the same routine check formula  
   **BUT** the *Defenseless* condition while *Bound* does not reduce the target's ability to attempt escape  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_212.md` — Ch8 "Grab", lines 14915–14958

5. **WHEN** the *Escape* is not distinct from the *Grab Resistance Check*  
   **THEN** the system distinguishes: *Grab Resistance Check* fires immediately after a hit to determine the hold; *Escape* is a separate move-action attempt on subsequent turns

## Story: `Resolve Toughness Resistance Check Against Damage`

**Story type:** system

### Domain terms

- *Toughness Resistance Check* — d20 + Toughness rank vs. Damage rank + 15; the check each hit target makes
- *Damage DC* — Damage rank + 15; higher than the standard resistance formula (rank + 10)
- *Degree of Failure* — the gap between the target's result and the DC; determines which condition is applied
- *Cumulative Toughness Penalty* — −1 per failure, applied to all future *Toughness Resistance Checks*

### Acceptance criteria

1. **WHEN** an attack with a Damage effect hits  
   **THEN** the system prompts the target to make a *Toughness Resistance Check* (d20 + Toughness vs. Damage rank + 15)  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_203.md` — Ch8 "Damage Resistance Check", lines 14435–14489

2. **WHEN** the target succeeds on the *Toughness Resistance Check*  
   **THEN** no damage condition or penalty is applied  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_203.md` — Ch8 "Damage Resistance Check", lines 14435–14489

3. **WHEN** the target fails by one degree  
   **THEN** the system applies a −1 *Cumulative Toughness Penalty* to all future *Toughness Resistance Checks*  
   **AND** no damage condition change occurs beyond the penalty  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_203.md` — Ch8 "Damage Resistance Check", lines 14435–14489

4. **WHEN** the target has *Impervious Toughness* at rank N  
   **THEN** the system ignores Damage effects with rank less than half N (rounded up) entirely  
   **AND** no *Toughness Resistance Check* is triggered for those low-rank attacks  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_216.md` — Ch8 "Lasting Injuries", lines 15092–15151

5. **WHEN** the *Cumulative Toughness Penalty* is accumulated  
   **THEN** the penalty applies to every future *Toughness Resistance Check* until the character recovers  
   **AND** it stacks across multiple hits from multiple attackers  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_203.md` — Ch8 "Damage Resistance Check", lines 14435–14489

## Story: `Apply Cumulative Toughness Penalty`

**Story type:** system

### Domain terms

- *Cumulative Toughness Penalty* — the −1 penalty added after every failed *Toughness Resistance Check*, regardless of degree
- *Stacking Penalty* — the total penalty across all failures; not capped; persists until recovery
- *Recovery* — the process of removing penalties and conditions; one condition per minute of rest

### Acceptance criteria

1. **WHEN** the target fails a *Toughness Resistance Check* by any degree  
   **THEN** the system adds a −1 *Cumulative Toughness Penalty* to the target's Toughness rank for all future checks  
   **AND** this applies in addition to any condition imposed by degree  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_203.md` — Ch8 "Damage Resistance Check", lines 14435–14489

2. **WHEN** the target is hit multiple times in a conflict  
   **THEN** each failure adds another −1 to the *Stacking Penalty* regardless of which attacker dealt the damage  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_203.md` — Ch8 "Damage Resistance Check", lines 14435–14489; `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_204.md` — Ch8 "Example of Conflict", lines 14490–14552

3. **WHEN** the target begins *Recovery* (rest)  
   **THEN** one −1 *Cumulative Toughness Penalty* is removed per minute after the worst damage condition is cleared  
   **AND** penalties stack and recover last; conditions recover first  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_216.md` — Ch8 "Lasting Injuries", lines 15092–15151

4. **WHEN** the target succeeds on a *Toughness Resistance Check*  
   **THEN** the success does not remove any *Cumulative Toughness Penalty*; only rest removes it  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_203.md` — Ch8 "Damage Resistance Check", lines 14435–14489

## Story: `Apply Damage Condition by Degree of Failure`

**Story type:** system

### Domain terms

- *One Degree of Failure* — −1 *Cumulative Toughness Penalty* only; no new condition
- *Two Degrees of Failure* — *Dazed* until end of next turn plus −1 penalty
- *Three Degrees of Failure* — *Staggered* plus −1 penalty; if already *Staggered*, treat as four degrees
- *Four Degrees of Failure* — *Incapacitated*
- *Staggered* — condition: limited to a single action per turn; supersedes *Dazed*
- *Incapacitated* — condition: defenseless, stunned, unaware; typically falls prone

### Acceptance criteria

1. **WHEN** the target fails the *Toughness Resistance Check* by one degree  
   **THEN** the system adds a −1 *Cumulative Toughness Penalty* and no condition change occurs  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_203.md` — Ch8 "Damage Resistance Check", lines 14435–14489

2. **WHEN** the target fails by two degrees  
   **THEN** the system imposes the *Dazed* condition (until end of next turn) and adds −1 penalty  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_203.md` — Ch8 "Damage Resistance Check", lines 14435–14489

3. **WHEN** the target fails by three degrees  
   **THEN** the system imposes the *Staggered* condition and adds −1 penalty  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_203.md` — Ch8 "Damage Resistance Check", lines 14435–14489

4. **WHEN** the target fails by three degrees and is already *Staggered*  
   **THEN** the system treats the result as four degrees of failure, imposing *Incapacitated*  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_203.md` — Ch8 "Damage Resistance Check", lines 14435–14489

5. **WHEN** the target fails by four degrees

   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_203.md` — Ch8 "Damage Resistance Check", lines 14435–14489

6. **WHEN** any degree of failure applies  
   **THEN** the −1 *Cumulative Toughness Penalty* is always added in addition to any condition change  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_203.md` — Ch8 "Damage Resistance Check", lines 14435–14489

## Story: `Transition Incapacitated Target to Dying`

**Story type:** system

### Domain terms

- *Incapacitated* — terminal damage condition: defenseless, stunned, unaware
- *Dying* — near-death state following further Toughness failure while *Incapacitated*
- *Dead* — the terminal outcome if a *Dying* character fails another Toughness resistance check
- *Second Active Effort* — the GM convention that major characters require a deliberate second attack to die

### Acceptance criteria

1. **WHEN** an *Incapacitated* target is hit by another Damage attack and fails the *Toughness Resistance Check*  
   **THEN** the system transitions the character from *Incapacitated* to *Dying*  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_203.md` — Ch8 "Damage Resistance Check", lines 14435–14489

2. **WHEN** a *Dying* character is hit and fails another *Toughness Resistance Check*  
   **THEN** the character dies  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_203.md` — Ch8 "Damage Resistance Check", lines 14435–14489

3. **WHEN** a *Dying* character is from a hazard (suffocation, vacuum) and cannot breathe  
   **THEN** the character cannot stabilize from *Dying* until the cause is removed  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_202.md` — Ch8 "Vacuum", lines 14386–14434

4. **WHEN** the GM applies the *Second Active Effort* convention for major characters  
   **THEN** accidental death from a single hit while *Incapacitated* is prevented unless the attacker declares lethal intent  
   **AND** for minions, death can be declared by intent on any successful attack  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_216.md` — Ch8 "Lasting Injuries", lines 15092–15151

## Story: `Apply Minion Defeat Rule on Any Resistance Failure`

**Story type:** system

### Domain terms

- *Minion* — a minor character with simplified defeat rules
- *Minion Defeat Rule* — any resistance failure by a *Minion* results in the worst degree of that effect
- *Routine Attack Check* — a non-minion attacker with a bonus ≥ 0 may auto-hit a *Minion* without rolling
- *No Critical Hits* — *Minions* cannot score critical hits against non-minions

### Acceptance criteria

1. **WHEN** a *Minion* fails any resistance check  
   **THEN** the system applies the worst possible degree of failure for that effect (e.g., *Incapacitated* for Damage)  
   **AND** skips graduated degree calculation  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_208.md` — Ch8 "Defenses/Cover" block, lines 14738–14790

2. **WHEN** a non-*Minion* character targets a *Minion*  
   **THEN** the system permits the attacker to declare a *Routine Attack Check* (guaranteed hit) if their *Attack Bonus* is ≥ 0  
   **AND** the *Minion* must still make their resistance check after the hit  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_209.md` — Ch8 "Vulnerable and Defenseless", lines 14791–14830

3. **WHEN** a *Minion* rolls a natural 20 on an attack check against a non-minion  
   **THEN** the hit is confirmed but no critical threat is generated  
   **BUT** the attack still hits and triggers the target's resistance check normally  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_208.md` — Ch8 "Defenses/Cover" block, lines 14738–14790

4. **WHEN** the GM uses *Group Initiative* for a *Minion Group*  
   **THEN** each surviving member of the group acts on the shared *Turn Slot*  
   **AND** each *Minion* is still tracked individually for defeat purposes

## Story: `Recover from Damage in Conflict`

**Story type:** user

### Domain terms

- *Recover Action* — a standard action consuming the entire turn; usable once per conflict
- *Once-Per-Conflict Limit* — the *Recover Action* may only be used once regardless of conditions that return
- *Recovery Benefit* — removes the worst current damage or fatigue condition; OR makes an additional resistance check against an ongoing effect
- *Defense Bonus* — +2 to active defenses (Dodge and Parry) until the start of the character's next turn, granted on recovery

### Acceptance criteria

1. **WHEN** the *Player* declares the *Recover Action*  
   **THEN** the system removes the character's worst current damage or fatigue condition  
   **AND** grants +2 to active defenses (*Defense Bonus*) until the start of their next turn  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_207.md` — Ch8 "Recovery", lines 14690–14737; `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_213.md` — Ch8 "Move/Ready" block, lines 14959–14998

2. **WHEN** the *Player* chooses to use the *Recover Action* to make an additional resistance check  
   **THEN** the system makes one extra resistance check against a chosen ongoing effect, beyond the normal end-of-turn check  
   **AND** success removes that effect and its conditions  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_207.md` — Ch8 "Recovery", lines 14690–14737

3. **WHEN** the character has already used the *Recover Action* in this conflict  
   **THEN** the system blocks a second use for the remainder of the conflict  
   **BUT** the *Once-Per-Conflict Limit* does not block the automatic end-of-turn resistance checks  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_207.md` — Ch8 "Recovery", lines 14690–14737

4. **WHEN** the *Recover Action* is used  
   **THEN** the entire turn is consumed — the character takes no other standard, move, or free actions on that turn  
   **AND** any remaining damage conditions beyond the one removed still require rest to heal  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_207.md` — Ch8 "Recovery", lines 14690–14737

5. **WHEN** the character used extra effort and also uses the *Recover Action*  
   **THEN** both may occur on the same turn; extra effort grants an additional action while the *Recover Action* uses the standard action  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_019.md` — Ch1 "Cost of Extra Effort", lines 1426–1475

## Story: `Remove Damage Condition After Rest`

**Story type:** system

### Domain terms

- *Natural Recovery* — the automatic removal of one damage condition per minute of rest for living targets
- *Recovery Order* — worst condition first: incapacitated → staggered → dazed → −1 Toughness penalties
- *Rest* — absence of combat and strenuous activity; the precondition for *Natural Recovery*
- *Healing / Regeneration* — effects that can accelerate *Natural Recovery* beyond the one-per-minute rate

### Acceptance criteria

1. **WHEN** a living character rests for one minute following combat  
   **THEN** the system removes one damage condition starting from the worst (*Recovery Order*)  
   **AND** each subsequent minute of rest removes the next worst condition  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_216.md` — Ch8 "Lasting Injuries", lines 15092–15151; `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_207.md` — Ch8 "Recovery", lines 14690–14737

2. **WHEN** all damage conditions are removed  
   **THEN** the system begins removing −1 *Cumulative Toughness Penalties* one per minute  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_216.md` — Ch8 "Lasting Injuries", lines 15092–15151

3. **WHEN** the character has a Healing or Regeneration effect  
   **THEN** the system applies that effect's rate in place of or in addition to the standard one-per-minute rate  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_207.md` — Ch8 "Recovery", lines 14690–14737

4. **WHEN** an inanimate object suffers damage  
   **THEN** *Natural Recovery* does not apply; the object must be repaired using the Technology skill

## Story: `Resolve Ongoing Effect Resistance Check at End of Turn`

**Story type:** system

### Domain terms

- *Ongoing Effect* — a power effect or hazard condition that persists across turns and requires repeated resistance
- *End-of-Turn Resistance Check* — the automatic d20 + defense vs. effect DC check at the end of each affected turn
- *Effect Removal* — the outcome of a successful *End-of-Turn Resistance Check*: the effect and all its conditions end
- *No-Action Cost* — the automatic check requires no action and cannot be skipped

### Acceptance criteria

1. **WHEN** a character ends their turn while under an *Ongoing Effect*  
   **THEN** the system automatically triggers an *End-of-Turn Resistance Check* (d20 + defense vs. effect DC)  
   **AND** no action is required to make this check  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_209.md` — Ch8 "Ongoing Effects", lines 14791–14830

2. **WHEN** the *End-of-Turn Resistance Check* succeeds  
   **THEN** the system removes the *Ongoing Effect* and all conditions it imposed  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_209.md` — Ch8 "Ongoing Effects", lines 14791–14830

3. **WHEN** the *End-of-Turn Resistance Check* fails  
   **THEN** the *Ongoing Effect* and its conditions remain; another check fires at the end of the character's next turn  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_209.md` — Ch8 "Ongoing Effects", lines 14791–14830

4. **WHEN** the character uses the *Recover Action* during their turn  
   **THEN** they receive an additional resistance check against one *Ongoing Effect* beyond the automatic end-of-turn check  
   **AND** the automatic end-of-turn check still fires at the end of the turn as normal

## Story: `Apply Concealment Penalty to Attack Check`

**Story type:** system

### Domain terms

- *Concealment* — perceptual obstruction preventing clear target identification; applies to attack checks
- *Partial Concealment* — dim lighting, foliage, fog, smoke: −2 penalty to *Attack Bonus*
- *Total Concealment* — complete darkness, heavy smoke: −5 penalty; attacker must also know target's approximate position
- *Counters Concealment* — a Senses effect that negates the *Concealment* penalty for the matching type

### Acceptance criteria

1. **WHEN** the attacker cannot clearly perceive the target due to environmental conditions  
   **THEN** the system determines *Partial* or *Total Concealment* based on the obstruction  
   **AND** applies the corresponding penalty to the attacker's *Attack Bonus*  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_207.md` — Ch8 "Concealment", lines 14690–14737; `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_200.md` — Ch8 "Light and Darkness", lines 14260–14332

2. **WHEN** *Partial Concealment* applies  
   **THEN** the system subtracts −2 from the *Attack Bonus*  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_207.md` — Ch8 "Concealment", lines 14690–14737

3. **WHEN** *Total Concealment* applies  
   **THEN** the system subtracts −5 from the *Attack Bonus*  
   **AND** the attacker must know or guess the approximate area where the target is; the system may require an additional check  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_207.md` — Ch8 "Concealment", lines 14690–14737

4. **WHEN** the attacker has a *Counters Concealment* Senses effect matching the source of concealment  
   **THEN** the system removes the penalty for that concealment type  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_200.md` — Ch8 "Light and Darkness", lines 14260–14332

5. **WHEN** the attack is an area or perception-range effect  
   **THEN** no *Concealment* penalty is applied; those effects bypass attack checks entirely  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_016.md` — Ch1 "Attack Checks", lines 1195–1237

## Story: `Apply Cover Penalty to Attack Check`

**Story type:** system

### Domain terms

- *Cover* — physical obstruction that could block or deflect an attack; reduces attack accuracy
- *Partial Cover* — roughly half the target behind obstruction: −2 penalty to *Attack Bonus*
- *Total Cover* — three-quarters or more behind obstruction: −5 penalty to *Attack Bonus*
- *Complete Cover* — target fully behind obstruction: attack cannot target the character; may target the cover

### Acceptance criteria

1. **WHEN** the target is behind *Partial Cover*  
   **THEN** the system applies a −2 *Circumstance Modifier* to the *Attack Bonus*  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_208.md` — Ch8 "Cover", lines 14738–14790

2. **WHEN** the target is behind *Total Cover*  
   **THEN** the system applies a −5 *Circumstance Modifier* to the *Attack Bonus*  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_208.md` — Ch8 "Cover", lines 14738–14790

3. **WHEN** the target is behind *Complete Cover*  
   **THEN** the system prevents the attack from targeting that character directly  
   **AND** the attacker may redirect the attack against the cover itself  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_208.md` — Ch8 "Cover", lines 14738–14790

4. **WHEN** area or perception-range effects are involved  
   **THEN** no *Cover* penalty is applied to the auto-hit; however, *Cover* grants a Dodge bonus to the resistance check  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_208.md` — Ch8 "Cover", lines 14738–14790

## Story: `Apply Cover Bonus Against Area Effect`

**Story type:** system

### Domain terms

- *Cover Bonus* — a circumstance bonus to *Dodge Resistance Checks* against area effects equal to the cover's attack penalty
- *Area Effect Origin* — the source point of the area effect; the cover must be between origin and target for the bonus
- *Dodge Resistance Check* — the resistance check against area effects

### Acceptance criteria

1. **WHEN** a character behind cover is targeted by an area effect  
   **THEN** the system applies a *Cover Bonus* to the character's *Dodge Resistance Check* equal to the cover's attack penalty  
   **AND** *Partial Cover* grants +2 to the resistance check; *Total Cover* grants +5  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_208.md` — Ch8 "Cover", lines 14738–14790

2. **WHEN** the cover is not between the target and the area effect's origin  
   **THEN** no *Cover Bonus* applies to the *Dodge Resistance Check*  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_208.md` — Ch8 "Cover", lines 14738–14790

3. **WHEN** the character is behind *Complete Cover* relative to the area effect's origin  
   **THEN** the system grants the maximum available *Cover Bonus* (+5) to the *Dodge Resistance Check*  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_208.md` — Ch8 "Cover", lines 14738–14790

4. **WHEN** the area effect does not require a *Dodge Resistance Check* (e.g., targets Will or Fortitude only)  
   **THEN** no *Cover Bonus* is applied to that resistance check; cover only helps Dodge-based checks against area effects

## Story: `Execute Team Attack with Coordinated Attackers`

**Story type:** user

### Domain terms

- *Team Attack* — a coordinated multi-attacker action combining compatible attacks against a single target
- *Compatibility Requirement* — all attacks must share the same effect type, resistance defense, and be within 5 ranks of each other
- *Delay Requirement* — all team attackers must delay to the same initiative slot (slowest attacker's position)
- *Main Attack* — the attack with the highest effect rank; carries the combined result

### Acceptance criteria

1. **WHEN** multiple *Players* coordinate a *Team Attack*  
   **THEN** each participating attacker delays to the slowest attacker's *Turn Slot*  
   **AND** each makes their individual attack check against the target's *Defense Class*  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_216.md` — Ch8 "Team Attack", lines 15092–15151

2. **WHEN** the *Compatibility Requirement* is not met (different effect types, different resistance defenses, or more than 5 ranks apart)

## Story: `Resolve Team Attack Bonus from Combined Hits`

**Story type:** system

### Domain terms

- *Combined Degrees* — the total degrees of success from all contributing (non-main) attacks that hit
- *Team Bonus* — +2 to *Main Attack* rank for 1 combined degree; +5 for 3 or more combined degrees
- *No-Failure Penalty* — unlike standard team checks, degrees of failure do not reduce the combined result

### Acceptance criteria

1. **WHEN** exactly one combined degree of success is contributed by non-main attackers  
   **THEN** the system adds a +2 circumstance bonus to the *Main Attack*'s effect rank  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_216.md` — Ch8 "Team Attack", lines 15092–15151

2. **WHEN** three or more combined degrees of success are contributed  
   **THEN** the system adds a +5 circumstance bonus to the *Main Attack*'s effect rank  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_216.md` — Ch8 "Team Attack", lines 15092–15151

3. **WHEN** two combined degrees of success are contributed  
   **THEN** the system applies the 1-degree rule (+2 bonus) since the rules only specify 1 degree and 3+ degrees  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_216.md` — Ch8 "Team Attack", lines 15092–15151

4. **WHEN** some contributing attacks miss  
   **THEN** their misses do not reduce the *Combined Degrees* or penalize the *Main Attack*  
   **AND** only the hits from non-main attackers count toward the *Team Bonus*  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_216.md` — Ch8 "Team Attack", lines 15092–15151

5. **WHEN** the *Team Attack* is fully resolved  
   **THEN** the target makes one resistance check against the boosted *Main Attack* effect rank

### Acceptance criteria

1. **WHEN** a character falls  
   **THEN** the system computes *Falling Damage Rank* as 4 + (2 × distance rank fallen)  
   **AND** applies that as a Toughness resistance check (DC = rank + 15) against the falling character  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_200.md` — Ch8 "Light and Darkness / Suffocation block", lines 14260–14332

- *Power Catch* — using a Flight or Move Object effect rank as a substitute for Strength in damage absorption

### Acceptance criteria

1. **WHEN** a *Player* declares an attempt to catch a falling character  
   **THEN** the system resolves the *Catch Check* (DC 5 Dexterity check)  
   **AND** on success, the catcher's Strength rank is subtracted from the *Falling Damage Rank*  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_200.md` — Ch8 "Light and Darkness / Suffocation block", lines 14260–14332

2. **WHEN** the *Catch Check* succeeds and some falling damage rank remains after absorption

- *Stabilization Block* — a *Dying* character cannot stabilize while the cause (no air) persists

### Acceptance criteria

1. **WHEN** a character begins holding their breath  
   **THEN** the system tracks the *Breath-Holding Limit* (10 + 2 × Stamina rank rounds)  
   **AND** no check is required until the limit expires  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_200.md` — Ch8 "Suffocation", lines 14260–14332

2. **WHEN** the *Breath-Holding Limit* expires

   **AND** the DC increases by +1 for each subsequent round  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_200.md` — Ch8 "Suffocation", lines 14260–14332

3. **WHEN** the *Suffocation Check* fails  
   **THEN** the system transitions the character to *Incapacitated* that round  
   **AND** the following round, the character becomes *Dying*  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_200.md` — Ch8 "Suffocation", lines 14260–14332

4. **WHEN** the character is *Dying* from suffocation

### Acceptance criteria

1. **WHEN** the *Player* targets an unattended inanimate object  
   **THEN** the object is *Defenseless* (Defense Class 10) and the system permits a *Finishing Attack Option*  
   **AND** the player chooses either the routine check (auto-hit) or a normal check (auto-crit on any hit)  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_206.md` — Ch8 "Damaging Objects", lines 14631–14689

2. **WHEN** the player chooses the normal *Attack Check* against a *Defenseless* object  
   **THEN** any hit automatically generates a critical hit (+5 to effect DC)  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_206.md` — Ch8 "Damaging Objects", lines 14631–14689

3. **WHEN** the *Player* declares a *Smash Action* against an object held by another character

## Story: `Spend Hero Point to Re-Roll Die`

**Story type:** user

### Domain terms

- *Hero Point Re-Roll* — re-roll any die roll and take the better result; a *Reaction*
- *Re-Roll Floor Rule* — if the second roll (the re-roll) shows 1–10, add 10; ensures the re-roll always produces 11–20
- *Before-Announcement Constraint* — the hero point must be spent before the GM announces the outcome of the original roll
- *Better Result Rule* — always take whichever of the two rolls (original or re-roll) is higher

### Acceptance criteria

1. **WHEN** a *Player* spends a hero point to re-roll  
   **THEN** the system re-rolls the specified die (d20 or other) as a *Reaction* before the GM announces the outcome  
   **AND** the player takes the higher of the original roll or the re-roll  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_021.md` — Ch1 "Improve Roll", lines 1516–1555

2. **WHEN** the re-roll result is 1 through 10  
   **THEN** the system adds 10 to the re-roll result, making the effective range 11–20  
   **AND** this boosted value is compared against the original roll to determine which is higher  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_021.md` — Ch1 "Improve Roll", lines 1516–1555

3. **WHEN** the GM announces the outcome before the player spends the hero point

   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_021.md` — Ch1 "Improve Roll", lines 1516–1555

4. **WHEN** the original roll is a natural 20  
   **THEN** the player may still spend a hero point to re-roll, but the re-roll result will almost certainly be lower  
   **AND** the player takes the better of the two; natural 20 original is likely kept  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_021.md` — Ch1 "Improve Roll", lines 1516–1555

5. **WHEN** a hero point is spent for a re-roll  
   **THEN** the hero point is consumed; the player's count decreases by one  
   **AND** multiple re-rolls can be requested in one turn if the player has hero points to spend

   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_021.md` — Ch1 "Recover", lines 1516–1555

3. **WHEN** the character has no *Dazed*, *Fatigued*, *Stunned*, or *Exhausted* condition  
   **THEN** the *Condition Recovery Spend* has no target and the hero point should be applied to a valid spend type  
   **BUT** the player cannot bank the spend for a non-existent condition  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_021.md` — Ch1 "Recover", lines 1516–1555

   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_019.md` — Ch1 "Cost of Extra Effort", lines 1426–1475

2. **WHEN** the *Player* chooses the additional standard action benefit  
   **THEN** the character gains one extra standard action this turn, beyond normal allotment  
   **AND** this is not limited by power level  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_019.md` — Ch1 "Cost of Extra Effort", lines 1426–1475

3. **WHEN** the *Player* chooses +2 on one check and already has a +2 circumstance bonus on that check  
   **THEN** the system upgrades the existing +2 to +5 for that check  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_019.md` — Ch1 "Cost of Extra Effort", lines 1426–1475

4. **WHEN** the *Player* chooses +1 power rank  
   **THEN** the selected power's effect rank increases by +1 until the start of the character's next turn  
   **AND** the boosted rank may exceed the series power level cap  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_019.md` — Ch1 "Cost of Extra Effort", lines 1426–1475

5. **WHEN** *Extra Effort* is declared a second time on the same turn  
   **THEN** the system blocks the second declaration; the *Once-Per-Turn Limit* applies  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_019.md` — Ch1 "Cost of Extra Effort", lines 1426–1475

6. **WHEN** the character is already *Fatigued* and uses *Extra Effort*  
   **THEN** the *Deferred Fatigue* escalates to *Exhausted* at the start of the following turn  
   **AND** if already *Exhausted*, the character becomes *Incapacitated*

## Story: `Activate Power Stunt via Extra Effort`

**Story type:** user

### Domain terms

- *Power Stunt* — a temporary Alternate Effect of an existing power, instantiated via *Extra Effort*
- *Base Power Requirement* — the stunt must derive from one of the hero's existing powers
- *Scene Duration* — the *Power Stunt* lasts until end of scene or until its normal duration expires, whichever is first
- *Permanent Effects Exclusion* — powers with permanent duration cannot be used as the basis for a *Power Stunt*
- *No-Fatigue Critical Hit Variant* — a *Power Stunt* gained via a *Critical Hit*'s Alternate Effect option costs no fatigue

### Acceptance criteria

1. **WHEN** the *Player* declares a *Power Stunt* via *Extra Effort*  
   **THEN** the system checks that the stunt derives from an existing power on the character's sheet (*Base Power Requirement*)  
   **AND** grants the stunt at *Scene Duration* (until end of scene or effect expiry)  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_019.md` — Ch1 "Cost of Extra Effort", lines 1426–1475

2. **WHEN** the base power is a permanent-duration effect  
   **THEN** the system blocks the *Power Stunt*; permanent effects are excluded as bases  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_019.md` — Ch1 "Cost of Extra Effort", lines 1426–1475

3. **WHEN** the *Power Stunt* is activated via *Extra Effort*  
   **THEN** *Deferred Fatigue* fires at the start of the following turn  
   **AND** the stunt remains available for its *Scene Duration* even after the fatigue cost resolves  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_019.md` — Ch1 "Cost of Extra Effort", lines 1426–1475

4. **WHEN** the *Power Stunt* was obtained via a *Critical Hit*'s Alternate Effect option  
   **THEN** no fatigue cost is imposed; the stunt is free  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_203.md` — Ch8 "Critical Hits", lines 14435–14489

5. **WHEN** the scene ends  
   **THEN** the *Power Stunt* expires and the character reverts to their normal power set  
   **BUT** the *Deferred Fatigue* cost (if any) already resolved at the start of the following turn earlier in the scene

## Story: `Spend Hero Point to Remove Extra Effort Fatigue`

**Story type:** user

### Domain terms

- *Fatigue Removal Spend* — spending a hero point at the start of the turn following extra effort to negate the *Deferred Fatigue*
- *Start-of-Turn Constraint* — the hero point must be spent at the START of the following turn, not immediately after extra effort
- *Deferred Fatigue* — the fatigue cost that fires at the start of the turn after extra effort was used
- *No-Adverse-Effect Outcome* — if the hero point is spent at the right moment, the character suffers no fatigue at all

### Acceptance criteria

1. **WHEN** the turn following extra effort begins  
   **THEN** the system fires *Deferred Fatigue* at the START of that turn  
   **AND** the player may spend a hero point at that exact moment to cancel the fatigue before it applies  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_019.md` — Ch1 "Cost of Extra Effort", lines 1426–1475

2. **WHEN** the hero point is spent at the start of the following turn  
   **THEN** the *Deferred Fatigue* is removed entirely and no fatigue condition is applied  
   **AND** the character proceeds with their full turn unimpaired  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_019.md` — Ch1 "Cost of Extra Effort", lines 1426–1475

3. **WHEN** the player attempts to spend a hero point to remove fatigue immediately after using extra effort (before the next turn)  
   **THEN** the *Start-of-Turn Constraint* is not yet satisfied; the spend must wait until the start of the following turn  
   **BUT** the player may spend hero points for other purposes in the meantime  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_019.md` — Ch1 "Cost of Extra Effort", lines 1426–1475

4. **WHEN** the player has no hero points at the start of the following turn  
   **THEN** the *Deferred Fatigue* fires and the character gains a fatigue condition  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_019.md` — Ch1 "Cost of Extra Effort", lines 1426–1475

5. **WHEN** the character used extra effort while *Fatigued* and cannot remove the escalating fatigue  
   **THEN** the *Deferred Fatigue* escalates the character's condition from *Fatigued* to *Exhausted*  
   **AND** a hero point can still remove this new condition via the *Condition Recovery Spend*  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_019.md` — Ch1 "Cost of Extra Effort", lines 1426–1475; `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_021.md` — Ch1 "Recover", lines 1516–1555

## Story: `Apply Extra Effort Fatigue at Start of Next Turn`

**Story type:** system

### Domain terms

- *Deferred Fatigue* — the fatigue condition applied at the start of the turn immediately after extra effort
- *Fatigue Escalation* — normal → fatigued → exhausted → incapacitated with each successive extra effort use without recovery
- *Hero Point Window* — the moment at the start of the following turn when a hero point can cancel *Deferred Fatigue*

### Acceptance criteria

1. **WHEN** a character used *Extra Effort* on their previous turn  
   **THEN** the system applies *Deferred Fatigue* at the start of the character's current turn, before any actions  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_019.md` — Ch1 "Cost of Extra Effort", lines 1426–1475

2. **WHEN** the player spends a hero point at the *Hero Point Window* (start of turn, after fatigue fires)  
   **THEN** the system removes the *Deferred Fatigue* condition  
   **AND** the character's turn proceeds normally without fatigue  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_019.md` — Ch1 "Cost of Extra Effort", lines 1426–1475

3. **WHEN** no hero point is spent and the character is not yet fatigued  
   **THEN** the system applies the *Fatigued* condition  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_019.md` — Ch1 "Cost of Extra Effort", lines 1426–1475

4. **WHEN** the character is already *Fatigued* when *Deferred Fatigue* fires  
   **THEN** the system escalates to *Exhausted*  
   **AND** if already *Exhausted*, escalates to *Incapacitated*  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_019.md` — Ch1 "Cost of Extra Effort", lines 1426–1475

5. **WHEN** extra effort benefits are not limited by power level  
   **THEN** the *Deferred Fatigue* cost is non-negotiable regardless of the benefit's magnitude  
   **BUT** a hero point can always be used to cancel it at the *Hero Point Window*  
   **Evidence:** `HeroesHandbook-rules__chunk_019.md` — Ch1 "Cost of Extra Effort", lines 1426–1475
