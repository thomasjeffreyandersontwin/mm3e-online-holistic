# Module: [Check]

_Object model for all Check terms. Concepts: Trait, Rank, Measurement, Check, Check Result, Condition. Subtypes: Graded Check Result, Opposed Check, Resistance Check, Routine Check, Team Check. Properties, instances, composites, and boundary terms modeled inline._

Scope: The d20 resolution mechanic (roll + modifier vs DC), checks (routine, opposed, resistance), degrees of success/failure, measurements and the Rank/Measure table, and conditions (basic and combined).

---

All uncertain outcomes are resolved with one mechanic: roll d20, add all appropriate modifiers, compare against a Difficulty Class; meeting or exceeding the DC is success. Each check is tied to exactly one trait. Opposed, resistance, and routine checks are specializations — not different systems. Graded checks produce degrees based on the margin above or below the DC; a natural 20 always increases the degree of success by one.

# Core Domain

## Trait

A trait is the base abstraction for every quantifiable game characteristic a character possesses — abilities, skills, defenses, powers, and advantages are all traits. Trait owns the concept of rank: every trait has a rank, a single numeric measure of its effectiveness, and that rank is the value that flows into checks as the modifier. Without a trait there is no rank, without a rank there is no modifier, and without a modifier there is no check. The Rank and Measure abstraction translates trait ranks into real-world values (mass, time, distance, volume), but it is the trait that carries the rank in the first place. Defenses (Dodge, Parry, Fortitude, Toughness, Will) are traits derived from abilities; they supply the DC or the modifier for resistance and attack checks. Other modules (Ability, Skill, Power, Advantage) define specific kinds of traits, but the abstract concept — a quantifiable characteristic with a rank — belongs here. Every trait is always referenced through a check ("Strength check," "Dodge resistance check"), making Trait the single point of connection between a character's capabilities and the resolution system.

### Trait

- is a *quantifiable characteristic* of a *character*
- has exactly one *rank* — the single numeric value measuring its effectiveness
- supplies its *rank* as the primary *modifier* for any *check* made using it; without a *trait* there is no *check*
- has a *difficulty ladder* — either a trait-specific one (e.g. *Athletics*, *Vehicles*) or the default ladder when no specific one exists
- *abilities*, *defenses*, *skills*, *powers*, and *advantages* are all *traits* — each is a subtype owned by its own module

#### Decisions made

- *Trait* is owned by this module as the base abstraction — other modules (*Ability*, *Skill*, *Power*, *Advantage*) define specific traits but the abstract concept of "quantifiable characteristic with a rank" belongs here.
- *Ability*, *defense*, *skill*, *power*, *advantage* are **subtypes** of *Trait* with distinct behavior — each is owned by its own module; this module defines only the abstract base.
- *Rank* is a concept — simple, but with its own scale, invariant, and interactions with *Check* and *Measurement*. *Trait* carries exactly one *Rank*.
- *Measurement* is a concept — it owns the conversion logic and the real-world value lookup. *Rank* feeds into it; *Measurement* produces the value.

### Rank

- is a single numeric value carried by a *trait* — the measure of that *trait's* effectiveness
- can be negative; each lower *rank* halves the previous *measurement* value
- supplies the base *modifier* for a *check* — the *trait's* *rank* flows directly into the *roll total*
- feeds into *Measurement* for conversion to real-world values (*mass*, *time*, *distance*, *volume*)
- follows a roughly doubling scale — each *rank* increase approximately doubles the *measurement* value
- **Invariant:** *ranks* must never be added directly; convert to *measures*, perform arithmetic on the *measures*, then convert back to a *rank*

#### Decisions made

- *Rank* is a concept, not a property of *Trait* — it has its own scale (doubling), its own invariant (no direct addition), and its own interactions (feeds into both *Check* as modifier and *Measurement* as lookup key). Simple, but distinct.

### Measurement

- translates a *rank* into a real-world value across four dimensions: *mass*, *time*, *distance*, and *volume*
- determines *throwing distance* by subtracting the *object's mass rank* from the *thrower's strength rank* and looking up the result as a *distance* value
- determines *travel distance* by adding *time rank* and *speed rank* and looking up the result as a *distance* value
- determines *travel time* by subtracting *speed rank* from *distance rank* and looking up the result as a *time* value
- resolves combined quantities by converting *ranks* to *measures*, performing the arithmetic on the *measures*, then converting back to a *rank*
- values at higher *ranks* are approximate — guidelines for play, not precise calculations

#### Decisions made

- *Measurement* is a concept — it has its own structure (four dimension types) and its own arithmetic rules (rank subtraction for throwing, rank addition for distance/time). *Rank* feeds in; *Measurement* produces the real-world value.
- The four dimension types (*mass*, *time*, *distance*, *volume*) are type properties of *Measurement*, not subtypes — every dimension follows the same doubling-scale lookup and rank-arithmetic rules.
- The formulas (throwing distance = strength rank − mass rank; travel distance = time rank + speed rank) are behaviors of *Measurement*, not of *Trait* or *Check* — they resolve ranks into outcomes using the measurement table.

## Check

A check is the core resolution mechanic — the single mechanism through which any uncertain outcome in the game is determined. It binds together a d20 roll, a trait-derived modifier, and a Difficulty Class into one comparison: roll plus modifier versus DC, with success on a match or exceed. The check owns this formula and is the single source of truth for whether an action succeeds or fails; no other abstraction may duplicate this determination. Three specialized forms exist within its boundary: opposed checks (two characters' results compared directly), resistance checks (defense bonus versus an effect's DC, typically 10 + effect rank), and routine checks (a fixed result of 10 replacing the die, used when circumstances are not demanding). Trait supplies the modifier, and the GM controls which DCs, circumstance modifiers, and routine allowances apply. Every check references exactly one trait — "Strength check," "Dodge resistance check" — and without a trait there is no check.

A check must always produce a binary success/failure result. When graded, it yields a degree that the Degree abstraction interprets. A natural 20 is always a critical success (degree increased by one). Circumstance modifiers (±2 minor, ±5 major) and team checks (helpers rolling against DC 10 to grant bonuses) layer onto the base formula but never change its fundamental shape. The invariant: d20 + modifier vs DC, every time, no exceptions.

### d20

- is the instrument a *check* rolls — a property of *check*, not a separate concept

### check

- is made *using* the *trait* of a *character*
- is made *against* a *difficulty class* set by the *GM* or passing a selected *difficulty stage* from *difficulty ladder*
- may have a *circumstance modifier* applied to the check *result* (±2 minor, ±5 major)
- is resolved by *rolling* a *d20*, adding the *trait rank* and the *circumstance modifier* and comparing the *roll total* to the *difficulty class*, producing a *check result* 

- **Invariant:** shape is always *roll total* versus *difficulty class*; subtypes only vary how *total* or *DC* is produced

#### Decisions made

- *Check* alone owns *success/failure* for uncertain outcomes; nothing else reimplements *roll total* versus *difficulty class*.
- *Check result* is a concept, not a property of *Check* — it carries its own responsibilities (success/failure, margin, grading, degree mapping to conditions).
- *Degree of success* and *degree of failure* are properties of a *graded check result*, not standalone concepts.
- *Comparison check* (rank vs rank, no roll) stays a special case inside *opposed check*, not a second engine.
- *d20* is the instrument a *check* rolls — a property, not a separate concept.
- *Modifier* is a value slot on a *check* (primary from *trait rank*, plus stacked *circumstance modifiers*) — a property, not a concept.
- *Gamemaster*, *player character*, *non-player character* are user/actor roles, not domain objects in this module.

### Check Result

- is produced by a *check* — the outcome of comparing *roll total* to *difficulty class*
- is either *success* (*roll total* meets or exceeds *difficulty class*) or *failure* (below)
- carries the *margin* — how far above or below the *difficulty class* the *roll total* fell
- a *natural 20* can turn *failure* into *success*

---

### Graded Check Result *is a type of* Check Result

- adds *degrees of success* and *degrees of failure* based on the *margin*
- each full *five points* of *margin* above *difficulty class* adds a *degree of success*; each full *five points* below adds a *degree of failure*
- a *natural 20* increases the *degree of success* by one after normal calculation (*critical success*)
- on a *resistance check*, each *degree of failure* maps to a specific *condition* imposed on the *character*

### Difficulty Ladder

- is a ranked set of named *difficulty stages* linked to a *trait*
- supplies the *GM* with calibrated *difficulty classes* drawn from named *difficulty stages* rather than an arbitrary numeric DC
- provides a default ladder (Very Easy DC 0 through Nigh-impossible DC 40) when no *trait*-specific ladder exists
- trait-specific ladders (e.g. *Vehicles Difficulties*) reuse the same *stage descriptor* names but supply *task descriptions* scoped to the *trait*
- the *GM* may select a *difficulty stage* from the ladder and pass its *DC value* directly to a *check*

#### Decisions made

- *Difficulty Ladder* is a concept, not a property of *Trait* or *DC* — it owns its own structure (a ranked set of *difficulty stages*) and its own responsibility (providing calibrated named DCs for a specific trait).
- The general Difficulty Classes ladder (DC 0–40) is the default instance; trait-specific ladders are not subtypes — they share the same stage structure but supply different task descriptions.

### Difficulty Stage

- is a single named entry within a *difficulty ladder*
- carries a *stage descriptor* (e.g. Easy, Challenging, Heroic), a *DC value* (in steps of 5 from 0 to 40), and a *task description* for the linked *trait*
- the *stage descriptor* is the domain name used to communicate task difficulty — "Challenging" or "Formidable" — not a row number or index
- supplies its *DC value* to a *check* when the GM selects this stage rather than setting a numeric DC directly

#### Decisions made

- *Difficulty Stage* is a concept within a *Difficulty Ladder* — each stage carries its own descriptor, DC, and task description; it is not a generic "row" or "entry."

### opposed check *is a type of* check

- is made against an *opposing character's* *check result* as the *difficulty class*
- is rolled by both the *active character* and the *opposing character*; the *higher result* wins
- on a *tie*, the *higher bonus* wins; if *bonuses* also tie, a *tie-break d20* decides (1–10 vs 11–20)
- *passive opposition* sets *difficulty class* to *opposing trait modifier + 10* when the *opponent* is not *actively contesting*
- a *comparison check* skips the *d20* and compares *ranks* directly — higher *rank* wins; no luck involved

### resistance check *is a type of* check

- uses a *defense bonus* (from a *defense trait*) as its *modifier*

- each *degree of failure* in the *result* maps to a specific *condition* imposed on the *character*

### routine check *is a type of* check

- if *10 + modifiers* meets or exceeds the *difficulty class*, the *character* succeeds without *rolling*
- if the *routine total* is insufficient, the *character* may still *roll* — the task is by definition not *routine* for that *character*
- some *traits* widen what counts as *routine* for a given *character*

- *helper failure* may impose a −2 *circumstance modifier* on the *leader's* *check*
- the *leader's* *check result* determines the outcome — *helpers* only modify it

## Condition

Condition is the status-effect system that translates mechanical outcomes — failed resistance checks, fatigue from extra effort, environmental hazards — into named states that impose concrete modifiers on a character. Each condition tracks its *condition source* (the power, effect, attacker, or event that imposed it) and carries an active or inactive status; only active conditions apply their modifiers. Basic conditions impose a single modifier (dazed limits actions, impaired applies −2, vulnerable halves defenses); combined conditions bundle multiple basics under one name (staggered = dazed + hindered, incapacitated = defenseless + stunned + unaware), and individual constituents can be resolved or superseded independently. Condition owns the supersession hierarchy (dazed → stunned, impaired → disabled → debilitated, vulnerable → defenseless, hindered → immobile) and three distinct supersession rules: when a source imposes a more severe condition than one it already imposed, the lesser is removed; when a source would impose a lesser condition it already surpassed, nothing happens; when a lesser condition arrives from a different source while a more severe one is already active, the lesser is parked as inactive and becomes active once the blocking condition is gone. Condition interacts with Check by consuming degrees of failure from resistance checks, with Hero Point which can directly remove specific conditions via Recover, and with Extra Effort whose fatigue cost imposes conditions on the fatigued → exhausted → incapacitated escalation track. When multiple active conditions apply, all effects stack.

### condition

- is a named *state* carried by a *character*; the *source* (effect, injury, fatigue, or hazard) does the imposing — the condition is what the character then carries and enforces
- is created from a *condition source* and carries an *active* or *inactive* status
- *penalizes* a suffering *character* according to a *game modifier* (*impaired* applies −2 penalty, *vulnerable* halves defenses)
- may also *restrict* a suffering *character* (e.g. *dazed* limits actions)
- enforces *penalties* and *restrictions* on a *character* only when *active*; enforcement handled by *action round structure* (Combat) and by *checks* (this module)
- when multiple *active conditions* apply, all effects stack
- it *supersedes* a less severe *condition*
- is *superseded_by* a more severe *condition* that overrides it
- is *removed* when the same *source* imposes a more severe *condition*
- is *unchanged* when the same *source* would impose a *condition* that is *superseded_by* an *active* more severe condition
- is *inactive* when imposed by one source while *superseded_by* an active *condition* from a *different source*
- is *active* when the blocking *condition* from the other source that *supersedes* this condition is removed — modifiers then apply
- is removed when its *condition source* ends
- **Invariant:** only *active* conditions apply modifiers; same-source supersession removes the lesser condition entirely; different-source supersession parks it as *inactive* until the blocking condition is gone

#### Decisions made

- Each named *condition* (*dazed*, *stunned*, *impaired*, etc.) is an **instance** of *Condition*, not a subtype — they differ by data (which modifiers, which restrictions) but share the same lifecycle: applied, stacked, superseded, resolved.
- *Combined conditions* are **composites** — each names a bundle of *basic condition* instances, not a separate concept with its own behavior.
- *Condition* is imposed as a *result* of a *check* (typically via *degrees of failure* on a *resistance check*); the chain from check to condition is a cross-concept relationship, not duplicated resolution logic.
- Each *Condition* instance owns *supersedes* and *superseded_by* as properties — the *supersession chain* is navigable through condition data itself, not via a separate runtime object.

### game modifier

- carries a *penalty value* (e.g. −2 for *impaired*, −5 for *disabled*) and/or a *restriction description* (e.g. "limited to free actions and one standard action")
- is owned by a *condition* — each *condition* has exactly one *game modifier* that defines the mechanical effect it imposes
- is applied to a *character* when the owning *condition* becomes *active*; removed when the *condition* is removed or becomes *inactive*

---

### condition source

- is the *power* *effect* and *attacker*, or *event/situation* that imposed a *condition* on a *character*
- is recorded when the *condition* is applied; used to distinguish same-source from different-source *supersession*
- is data owned by the *condition* — it has no lifecycle of its own
- **Invariant:** two *conditions* sharing the same *condition source* are evaluated under same-source supersession rules; conditions from different sources are evaluated under different-source rules

#### Decisions made

- *Condition Source* is a **value** on the *Condition* instance, not a separate runtime object — it is the identity token (name, reference, or descriptor) of whatever caused the condition to be imposed.

### Basic conditions (instances of Condition)

- *dazed* — limited to *free actions* and one *standard action* per turn; superseded by *stunned*
- *stunned* — cannot take any *actions*, including *free actions*; supersedes *dazed*
- *vulnerable* — *active defenses* halved (round up); superseded by *defenseless*
- *defenseless* — *active defense bonuses* become 0; attackers may use *routine checks*; forgoing routine makes any hit a *critical hit*; supersedes *vulnerable*
- *impaired* — −2 *circumstance penalty* on *checks* (may be scoped to a *trait*); superseded by *disabled*
- *disabled* — −5 *circumstance penalty* on *checks* (may be scoped); superseded by *debilitated*
- *weakened* — temporary *power point* loss in a *trait*; superseded by *debilitated*
- *debilitated* — one or more *abilities* lowered below −5
- *hindered* — half normal *speed* (−1 *speed rank*); superseded by *immobile*
- *immobile* — no *movement speed*; still capable of *actions* unless another *condition* prevents it
- *compelled* — limited to *free actions* and one *standard action* chosen by the *controller*; superseded by *controlled*
- *controlled* — all *actions* each turn dictated by another *character*
- *fatigued* — *hindered*; recovers after one hour of rest
- *normal* — unharmed, unaffected, acting normally
- *transformed* — some or all *traits* altered by an outside agency; *power point total* cannot increase
- *unaware* — completely unaware of surroundings; cannot make *interaction* or *Perception checks* (may be scoped to specific senses)

### Combined conditions (composites of basic conditions)
- a *combined condition* bundles multiple *basic conditions* under one name; individual *constituents* can be *resolved* or *superseded* independently


- *staggered* = *dazed* + *hindered*
- *incapacitated* = *defenseless* + *stunned* + *unaware*; generally fall *prone*
- *dying* = *incapacitated* + near death; *Fortitude* DC 15 each round — two *degrees of success* stabilizes, three total *degrees of failure* means death
- *exhausted* = *impaired* + *hindered*; recovers after one hour of comfortable rest
- *asleep* = *defenseless* + *stunned* + *unaware*; hearing *Perception check* (3+ *degrees of success*) or shaking wakes the *character*
- *blind* = *hindered* + visually *unaware* + *vulnerable*; may also be *impaired* or *disabled* for vision-dependent activities
- *bound* = *defenseless* + *immobile* + *impaired*
- *deaf* — auditory concealment from the *character*; may allow surprise attacks
- *entranced* = *stunned*; any obvious *threat* breaks the trance; an ally can free with *interaction skill check* (DC 10 + *effect rank*)
- *paralyzed* = *defenseless* + *immobile* + physically *stunned*; still aware; can take purely mental *actions*
- *prone* — −5 *close attack penalty*; opponents get +5 *close* / −5 *ranged attack modifier*; *hindered*; standing up is a *move action*
- *restrained* = *hindered* + *vulnerable*; if anchored to an *immobile* object, *immobile* instead of *hindered*
- *surprised* = *stunned* + *vulnerable*

# Boundary Domain

## Effect / power effect

Owned by: Power

- has a *rank* that determines the *resistance check* DC (DC = rank + 10)
- may impose one or more *conditions* on a *character* based on the type of effect and the *degree of failure* on the resistance check
- may be **ongoing** for a target *character*: requires a *resistance check* at the end of each of the target's turns until ended
- when ongoing and the *resistance check* succeeds: the effect ends and all *conditions* it imposed on the *character* are removed
- when ongoing and the *resistance check* fails: the effect persists; all conditions it imposed remain; further conditions may be added per the effect's description
- **Invariant:** an ongoing effect is either active or ended; when ended, all conditions it imposed — whether *active* or *inactive* — are removed from the *character*

#### Decisions made

- The "ongoing" quality is a property of an effect, not a separate concept. Whether an effect requires repeated resistance checks is determined by the Power module (the effect's definition), not by this module.
- This module is responsible only for the check-resolution behavior when an ongoing effect is in play: what happens on success (ends + conditions cleared) and failure (persists + conditions remain).
