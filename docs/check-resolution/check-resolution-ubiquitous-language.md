# Core Domain

## Trait

- A trait is any quantifiable game characteristic a character possesses — abilities, skills, advantages, powers, and defenses are all traits.
- Every trait has a rank; rank is the single numeric measure of a trait's effectiveness.
- A check is always a check *of* a trait — "Strength check," "Acrobatics check," "Dodge resistance check" — there is no check without a trait supplying the modifier.
- The Measurements Table translates trait ranks into real-world values (mass, time, distance, volume); traits are what have ranks, so measurements are a property of traits.
- Defenses (Dodge, Parry, Fortitude, Toughness, Will) are traits derived from abilities; they supply the DC or the modifier for resistance and attack checks.
- Other modules (Ability, Skill, Power, Advantage) define *specific* traits; the abstract concept of what a trait is — a quantifiable characteristic with a rank — belongs here.

## d20

- The game uses a single twenty-sided die (d20) to resolve actions.
- "d20+2" means roll the die and add two; "d20−4" means roll and subtract four.
- The die can also express percentages in increments of 5% (multiply the face value by 5).

## check

- A check is d20 + trait rank (plus any additional modifiers) vs a Difficulty Class (DC); equaling or exceeding the DC is success, below is failure.
- Whenever a character attempts something where the outcome is in doubt, it requires a check of an appropriate trait — ability, skill, power, etc.
- Additional modifiers come from circumstances, advantages, or power effects layered on top of the trait rank.
- A natural 20 on a check is a critical success: determine the degree normally, then increase it by one degree; this can turn a failure into a success.

## Difficulty Class (DC)

- The DC is a number set by the GM that a check result must equal or exceed to succeed.
- A standard difficulty scale runs from Very Easy (DC 0) through Nigh-Impossible (DC 40) in steps of 5.
- In some cases the DC is set by another character's trait (opposed checks) or by an effect's rank (resistance checks, typically 10 + effect rank).

## opposed check

- An opposed check pits two characters' check results against each other; the higher result wins.
- On a tie, the character with the higher bonus wins; if bonuses are also equal, roll d20 — 1–10 one character wins, 11–20 the other.
- Routine opposition sets the DC as the opposing character's modifier + 10 (used when the opponent is not actively opposing, e.g. a guard not specifically looking).
- A comparison check compares ranks directly without rolling; the higher rank wins (no luck involved).

## resistance check

- A resistance check is d20 + defense bonus vs the hazard's DC (typically 10 + effect rank).
- Resistance checks may be graded, with different outcomes at different degrees of success or failure.

---

## routine check

- A routine check substitutes a fixed result of 10 for the die roll; the GM decides when circumstances allow a routine check.
- A character with a +10 bonus achieves a routine result of 20, succeeding at DC 20 tasks without rolling.
- If a character's routine result is not sufficient for a task, the character may still roll; the task is by definition not routine for that character.
- Certain game traits change what tasks or situations count as "routine" for a character.

## degree of success

- A graded check counts each 5 full points above the DC as one additional degree of success; a bare success is one degree.
- Degrees of success range up to four (DC + 15 or higher).
- A natural 20 (critical success) increases the degree of success by one.
- Some checks specify specific results for each degree of success.

## degree of failure

- A graded check counts each 5 full points below the DC as one additional degree of failure; a bare failure is one degree.
- Degrees of failure range down to four (DC − 20 or lower), though more than two degrees of failure rarely matter in practice.
- Specific types of graded checks — notably resistance checks — give defined results for each degree of failure.

## modifier

- A modifier is a number added to or subtracted from a d20 roll before comparing to the DC.
- The primary modifier comes from the trait's rank; additional modifiers come from circumstances, advantages, or power effects.
- A minor circumstance modifier is ±2; a major circumstance modifier is ±5.
- Missing required tools imposes a −5 penalty; makeshift tools reduce this to −2.
- Circumstance modifiers apply to the check result (not the DC) for consistency.
- Team checks: one leader rolls normally; each helper checks the same trait against DC 10; helper success grants the leader a +2 or +5 circumstance bonus; helper failure can impose a −2 penalty.

## rank

- Every quantifiable trait has a rank — the single numeric value measuring that trait's effectiveness.
- Ranks can be negative; each lower rank halves the previous measurement.
- Ranks must not be added directly; convert to measures, add the measures, then convert back to a rank.

## measure

- The Measurements Table maps each rank to mass, time, distance, and volume on a roughly doubling scale.
- Distance Rank = Time Rank + Speed Rank; Time Rank = Distance Rank − Speed Rank; Throwing Distance Rank = Strength Rank − Mass Rank.
- Measurements are approximate, especially at higher ranks — guidelines, not precise values.

## hero point

- Players start each session with 1 hero point; unspent points do not carry over between sessions.
- Spending a hero point is a reaction (takes no time); a player can spend as many as they have.
- Improve Roll: re-roll any die roll and take the better result; on a 1–10 re-roll, add 10 (so the re-roll always yields 11–20); must spend before the GM announces the outcome.
- Edit Scene: add or change a scene detail with GM approval; cannot undo events that already occurred.
- Heroic Feat: gain one rank of an advantage the hero doesn't already have until end of next turn; fortune advantages excluded; prerequisites must be met.
- Inspiration: receive a hint, clue, or direction from the GM.
- Instant Counter: attempt to counter an effect used against the hero, as a reaction.
- Recover: immediately remove dazed, fatigued, or stunned; convert exhausted to fatigued.
- Heroes earn additional hero points during play from complications, acts of heroism, and roleplaying.

## extra effort

- Extra effort is a free action, declared by the player, limited to once per turn.
- Benefits (choose one): additional standard action; +2 circumstance bonus on one check (or upgrade existing bonus to +5); +1 rank to a power effect until start of next turn; power stunt (temporary Alternate Effect lasting until end of scene); additional resistance check against an ongoing effect; retry a failed effect; +1 speed rank until start of next turn; +1 Strength rank until start of next turn.
- Extra effort benefits are not limited by power level.
- Cost: at the start of the turn after using extra effort, the hero becomes fatigued; fatigued → exhausted; exhausted → incapacitated.
- Spending a hero point removes the fatigue cost of extra effort.

## power stunt

- A power stunt uses extra effort to temporarily gain an Alternate Effect of an existing power.
- The stunt lasts until end of scene or its duration expires, whichever comes first.
- Permanent effects cannot be used for power stunts.

## condition

- A condition is shorthand for a set of game modifiers imposed by effects, injuries, or fatigue.
- If multiple conditions apply, use all of their effects; some conditions supersede lesser ones.
- Each basic condition describes a single game modifier; they are the building blocks of the condition system.

## game modifier

- A game modifier is the penalty value or restriction description that a condition imposes on a character.
- Each condition carries exactly one game modifier — e.g. impaired carries a −2 circumstance penalty, dazed carries an action restriction.
- Game modifiers are applied to the character when the owning condition is active; they stack when multiple active conditions apply.

## condition source

- The condition source is the power effect, attacker, or event/situation that imposed a condition on a character.
- A single condition type (e.g. dazed) can be imposed by different sources simultaneously; each imposition tracks its own source.
- Used to distinguish same-source from different-source supersession: same-source supersession removes the lesser; different-source supersession parks the lesser as inactive.

## combined condition

- A combined condition bundles basic conditions under one name; individual constituents can be resolved or superseded independently.
- Example: if an effect removes the dazed part of staggered (dazed + hindered), the character is only hindered.

# Boundary Domain

## Effect / power effect

Owned by: Power

- An effect is the basic building block of a power; it describes what a power does in game terms.
- Resistance check DC is typically 10 + effect rank — the effect's rank is what the character resists against.
- Conditions are imposed by power effects (as well as by injuries, fatigue, and environmental hazards).
- Extra effort can increase a power effect by +1 rank; power stunts temporarily create an Alternate Effect.
- Instant Counter (hero point spend) attempts to counter an effect used against the character.

## Action round structure

Owned by: Combat

- A round is 6 seconds; each character gets one turn per round.
- On a turn: one standard action + one move action (or two move actions) + any free actions + reactions as triggered.
- Standard action: acting upon something (attack, use a power); limited to one per round.
- Move action: movement, drawing weapons, standing up, manipulating objects; taken before or after the standard action but not split around it.
- Free action: minor actions (talking, dropping something, ending or maintaining powers); as many as the GM considers reasonable.
