## Consolidation Notes (for AC phase)

### Resolve Checks

#### Apply Condition to Character (basic: dazed, stunned, vulnerable, defenseless, impaired, disabled, weakened, hindered, immobile, compelled, controlled, debilitated, fatigued, transformed, unaware, normal; combined: staggered, incapacitated, dying, exhausted, asleep, blind, bound, deaf, entranced, paralyzed, prone, restrained, surprised)
Groups 16 basic and 13 combined conditions into one parameterized story — all follow the same "apply condition modifiers to character" pattern. Basic conditions impose a single modifier; combined conditions bundle multiple basic conditions under one name (constituents can be superseded or resolved independently of each other while the combined condition persists).
AC must specify per basic condition:
- dazed: limit to free actions + one standard action; superseded by stunned
- stunned: no actions including free actions
- vulnerable: halve active defenses; superseded by defenseless
- defenseless: active defense bonuses become 0; attackers may use routine checks; forgoing routine makes any hit critical
- impaired: −2 circumstance penalty on checks; superseded by disabled
- disabled: −5 circumstance penalty on checks; superseded by debilitated
- weakened: temporary power point loss in a trait; superseded by debilitated
- hindered: half speed (−1 speed rank); superseded by immobile
- immobile: no movement speed
- compelled: free + one standard per turn, both chosen by controller; superseded by controlled
- controlled: all actions dictated by another character
- fatigued: hindered; recovers after one hour rest
- transformed: traits altered by outside agency; power points cannot increase
- unaware: cannot make interaction or Perception checks

AC must specify per combined condition:
- staggered: dazed + hindered
- incapacitated: defenseless + stunned + unaware; generally fall prone
- dying: incapacitated + near death; Fortitude DC 15 each round; two degrees of success stabilizes; three total degrees of failure = death
- exhausted: impaired + hindered; recovers after one hour rest
- asleep: defenseless + stunned + unaware; hearing check (3+ degrees) or shaking wakes
- blind: hindered + visually unaware + vulnerable; may also be impaired or disabled for vision-dependent activities
- bound: defenseless + immobile + impaired
- deaf: auditory concealment from the character; may allow surprise attacks
- entranced: stunned; obvious threat breaks trance; ally can free with interaction check (DC 10 + effect rank)
- paralyzed: defenseless + immobile + physically stunned; aware; purely mental actions allowed
- prone: −5 close attack penalty; opponents +5 close / −5 ranged; hindered; standing is move action
- restrained: hindered + vulnerable; if anchored, immobile instead of hindered
- surprised: stunned + vulnerable

#### Supersede Condition in Chain
Five supersession chains; AC must specify behavior per chain:
- dazed → stunned
- impaired → disabled → debilitated
- vulnerable → defenseless
- hindered → immobile
- compelled → controlled
Recovery note: supersession overrides while the more severe condition is present; removing the more severe condition reveals the lesser if its source effect is still active.

#### Derive Measurement from Rank Formula (distance, time, throwing distance)
Groups three rank-derivation formulas into one parameterized story — all follow the same "perform rank arithmetic then look up result in measurement table" pattern.
AC must specify per variant:
- distance: add Time Rank + Speed Rank, look up result as distance value
- time: subtract Speed Rank from Distance Rank, look up result as time value
- throwing distance: subtract object Mass Rank from thrower's Strength Rank, look up result as distance value

#### Moved to other modules
- Hero point, extra effort, power stunt, reaction → Combat module (per module partitioning)

### Character

#### Spend Power Points on X Ranks (Ability, Defense, Skill, Advantages, Powers)
Groups five distinct trait-category spend stories. Each uses the same "allocate PP at stated cost" pattern but has a different cost formula and different rules.
AC must specify per variant:
- Ability Ranks: 2 PP per ability rank; 8 ability scores (STR, STA, AGL, DEX, FGT, INT, AWE, PRE)
- Defense Ranks: 1 PP per rank above the base value provided by the related ability
- Skill Ranks: 1 PP per 2 total skill ranks (rounded down for odd totals)
- Advantages: 1 PP per advantage or per rank in a ranked advantage
- Powers: ((base effect cost + extras minus flaws) x rank) + flat modifiers; cost varies by chosen effect

#### Choose Complication
Consolidates enemy, identity, responsibility, relationship, secret, power loss, and any other non-Motivation, non-Weakness complication type. All share the construction-time pattern: Player chooses type, defines narrative detail, GM may overrule.
AC must specify per variant:
- Enemy: define adversary identity and nature of enmity (one-sided or mutual); GM introduces enemy in play when it causes specific harm to earn hero point
- Identity: choose public identity (reveal real name, live in public eye) or secret identity (maintain dual life, protect loved ones from knowledge); dual-identity heroes must track two personas
- Responsibility: define obligations (family, professional, civic) that compete with heroic duties; earning hero point requires responsibility to be visibly neglected or conflicted
- Relationship: define key people in hero's life (loved ones, mentors, rivals); if in the know about hero identity, they are danger targets; if not, hero must manage the dual life
- Secret: specify what is hidden and from whom (true identity, dark past, secret weakness); earning hero point requires active threat of exposure
- Power Loss: define triggering circumstances (specific substance, condition, location, or wavering motivation); earning hero point requires powers to actually fail due to trigger

#### Enforce Power Level Limits (Attack & Effect, Dodge & Toughness, Parry & Toughness, Fortitude & Will)
Groups four PL cap pairs that share the same rule shape: sum of both traits in pair must not exceed 2 x series power level. Each pair governs different traits.
AC must specify per pair:
- Attack & Effect: attack bonus + effect rank of that attack <= 2xPL; if effect allows resistance check but no attack check, effect rank alone <= PL
- Dodge & Toughness: Dodge + Toughness <= 2xPL; Dodge is active defense (purchased), Toughness is passive
- Parry & Toughness: Parry + Toughness <= 2xPL; Parry is close-combat active defense; Toughness shared with Dodge pair
- Fortitude & Will: Fortitude + Will <= 2xPL; both are resistance defenses, not active defenses

#### Raise Series Power Level
Consolidates the two outcomes of a PL increase: heroes gain cap headroom to spend PP on previously-maxed traits; GM reevaluates NPC challenge ratings.
AC must specify:
- Trigger: heroes have accumulated approximately 15 additional PP since series start or last PL increase
- Effect on heroes: PL raises by +1; heroes may now spend accumulated PP on traits that exceeded the old cap
- Effect on NPCs: GM reviews villain traits and may increase some to maintain challenge; no PP accounting required for NPCs

### Ability

#### Set Ability Rank
Groups buying-up and reducing-below-0 into one parameterized story. The 2 power point per rank formula applies in both directions. AC must specify per direction:
- Buying up (rank 0 → positive): spend 2 pp per +1 rank; each +1 raises ability from current value; cannot exceed power level cap.
- Reducing below 0 (rank 0 → negative): gain 2 pp per −1 rank; cannot go below −5 voluntarily.
- Applies to all eight named abilities (STR, STA, AGL, DEX, FGT, INT, AWE, PRE) with identical formula.

#### Apply Absent Ability Capability Restrictions
Groups per-ability absence effects into one parameterized story. All share "automatic fail on related checks" but have distinct capability losses per ability. AC must specify per ability:
- No Strength: cannot exert physical force; auto-fail Athletics, strength-based attack checks.
- No Stamina: no living-body mechanics; damage/recovery as inanimate object; immune to fatigue; no Fortitude defense.
- No Dexterity: cannot manipulate objects; no physical attacks; auto-fail Dexterity checks.
- No Agility: no self-propelled movement; no Dodge defense; auto-fail Agility checks.
- No Fighting: no close attacks; auto-fail close attack checks.
- No Intellect: automaton; immune to mental effects and interaction skills; no Will defense.
- No Awareness: completely unaware; also no Presence automatically; immune to mental effects; treated as inanimate object.
- No Presence: cannot interact; immune to interaction skills; no Will defense.

#### Apply Debilitated Ability Condition Effects
Groups four distinct condition sets by ability grouping into one parameterized story. Trigger is the same (rank drops below −5) but outcomes differ by ability. AC must specify per group:
- STR, AGL, or DEX: collapse — defenseless + immobilized + stunned (conscious and aware).
- STA: dying condition + additional −5 modifier on Fortitude checks to avoid death.
- FGT: dazed + defenseless; cannot make close attacks.
- INT, AWE, or PRE: unaware; persists until ability restored to at least −5.

#### Passive vs Active Runtime Analysis (Ability)
- Set Ability Rank → character creation / advancement time; no runtime story needed beyond cascade.
- Designate Ability Rank Portion as Enhanced → character creation time; runtime story is nullification (owned by Power module).
- Cascade Trait Changes → passive system behavior at the moment a rank changes; maps as a system story.
- Derive Base Defense Rank from Ability → passive derivation; automatic at character creation and on any rank change; mapped as system story.
- Apply Absent Ability Capability Restrictions → character design time; applied at creation; no separate runtime story for ongoing enforcement (the restrictions are always in effect).
- Apply Debilitated Ability Condition Effects → runtime (occurs when rank is reduced below −5 by a game effect); maps as system story.
- Clear Debilitated State When Ability Rank Recovers → runtime (recovery when rank returns to −5 or above); maps as system story.

### Skill

#### Assign Skill Ranks
Skill rank purchase follows a fixed 2-ranks-per-PP rate. Ranks may be split freely across any skills. The skill modifier limit (total skill modifier capped at PL + 10) is enforced at build time by Character, not at check time — AC should cover the rank assignment mechanics only, not the limit calculation.

#### Enforce Skill Modifier Limit
This is a system enforcement at character construction/advancement time — total skill modifier (rank + ability + misc) may not exceed PL + 10 for any skill. The limit interacts with trade-offs in Character; here it is simply the upper-bound check. AC must specify: what is the total modifier, what is the limit, and what happens if the limit is exceeded.

#### Make Skill Check
This is the core resolution story — parameterized across all 16 named skills. AC should cover: formula (d20 + rank + ability + circumstance), DC comparison, success/failure. The per-skill stories (Bluff, Climb, Hide, etc.) specify skill-specific DCs and outcomes. Do not duplicate the core formula in every per-skill story.

#### Apply Critical Success on Natural 20
Distinct from degree-of-success arithmetic: a natural 20 triggers a degree increase after normal calculation. AC must specify: when does a natural 20 apply (on any skill check), what happens to the degree, and what is the edge case (already at highest degree).

#### Resolve Untrained Skill Attempt
Two distinct behaviors: (1) skills without Trained Only marker — attempt proceeds with rank 0, ability modifier applies; (2) Trained Only skills — attempt automatically fails with no roll. AC must cover both paths.

#### Apply Skill Mastery Routine Result
Skill Mastery allows routine check result (bonus + 10) even under stress. AC must specify: which skill is nominated, what is the routine result, when does it apply (replaces a roll the character would otherwise be required to make).

#### Enforce Interaction Skill Requirements
Covers the three system-enforced gates before any interaction skill resolves: (1) subject awareness and comprehension (-5 if not met), (2) Intellect minimum (-5 for Int -5, blocked for subjects lacking mental abilities), (3) Immunity power effect (blocked entirely). These are pre-conditions shared by all three interaction skills; AC should use a parameterized structure.

#### Feint Opponent with Deception
Distinct from Bluffing — feinting is a combat action (standard action), makes the target vulnerable, and resolves in one round. Bluffing is a social action that changes NPC behavior persistently. AC must cover the vulnerability condition duration (until end of user's next round).

#### Intimidate Group of Minions
Distinct from single-target Coerce — uses a single check against a single GM-rolled group resistance; the effect must be identical for all members. AC must cover: same-effect requirement, single-resistance roll, minion definition.

#### Detect Illusion Secretly with Insight
GM makes this check on behalf of the character — the player does not decide when to attempt it. Distinct from Detect Outside Influence (which is player-initiated). AC must cover: secret roll, DC (10 + Illusion rank), outcome (success reveals illusion flaw).

#### Collect Physical Evidence vs. Analyze Collected Evidence
Two-step process: Gather Evidence (DC 15 check to collect without ruining it) must succeed before Analyze Evidence (DC 15 check to extract information). Failure to gather properly degrades analysis or makes it impossible. AC must cover both steps and their interaction.

#### Add Close Combat Rank to Attack Check / Add Ranged Combat Rank to Attack Check
Both follow the same narrow pattern: rank adds only to attack checks for the specific weapon/power named by the skill, not to any other attack, not to defense. These can be written with parallel AC structure. Distinguish from advantage-based bonuses (Close Attack, Ranged Attack) which apply more broadly.

#### Perform Jury-Rig Repair
Distinct from standard Repair: DC is 10 lower than building (not just 5 lower), takes a standard action (not hours), fixes only one problem, and lasts only until end of scene. Item cannot be jury-rigged again until fully repaired. AC must cover all four constraints.

#### Revive Dazed or Stunned Character
Distinct from Stabilize: removes dazed or stunned conditions (not dying), takes a standard action, leaves other conditions intact. Cannot awaken a dying character without stabilizing first. AC must cover the condition-specificity and the dying character limitation.

### Advantage

#### Execute Attack Trade-Off Maneuver (accurate, all-out, defensive, power)
Groups four attack modifier advantages into one parameterized story — all share the "declare penalty of up to −5 on one stat, add same value up to +5 to another stat" pattern, activated during the relevant maneuver type.
AC must specify per variant:
- Accurate Attack: penalty on effect modifier (−1 to −5), matching bonus to attack check bonus (up to +5); cannot exceed the penalty taken
- All-out Attack: penalty on active defenses — Dodge and Parry (−1 to −5), matching bonus to attack check bonus (up to +5)
- Defensive Attack: penalty on attack check bonus (−1 to −5), matching bonus to both active defenses — Dodge and Parry (up to +5)
- Power Attack: penalty on attack check bonus (−1 to −5), matching bonus to effect bonus of the attack (up to +5)
All variants: the penalty and bonus are equal in magnitude; neither can exceed 5; the pair is declared before the attack roll.

#### Apply Ranked Attack Bonus to Close or Ranged Attack Check (Close Attack, Ranged Attack)
Groups two ranked attack bonus advantages that share the same "+1 to attack checks per rank, capped by power level" pattern, differentiated only by attack type (close vs. ranged).
AC must specify per variant:
- Close Attack: applies to all close attack checks (armed and unarmed); total bonus still subject to power level cap
- Ranged Attack: applies to all ranged attack checks; total bonus still subject to power level cap
Both variants: the bonus is passive (always applies to the relevant attack type); separate from the Close Combat or Ranged Combat skill.

#### Passive vs Active Runtime Analysis (Combat Advantages)
- Accurate Attack → active (player declares maneuver per attack; needs an Execute story)
- All-out Attack → active (player declares per attack; same Execute story)
- Defensive Attack → active (player declares per attack; same Execute story)
- Power Attack → active (player declares per attack; same Execute story)
- Close Attack → passive (system applies flat bonus to every close attack; system story)
- Ranged Attack → passive (system applies flat bonus to every ranged attack; system story)
- Improved Initiative → passive (system applies bonus to every initiative roll; system story)
- Improved Critical → passive (system extends threat range on every attack; system story)
- Favored Environment → semi-active (player chooses allocation at start of each round; both a player declaration and a system application story)

#### Passive vs Active Runtime Analysis (Fortune Advantages)
- Luck → active (player declares re-roll on a specific roll, consumes one rank use)
- Inspire → active (player spends hero point + standard action; system applies to allies)
- Leadership → active (player spends hero point + standard action to remove condition from ally)
- Beginner's Luck → active (player spends hero point; system grants temp ranks)

#### Passive vs Active Runtime Analysis (Skill Advantages)
- Jack of all Trades → passive (system removes untrained restriction automatically when advantage is held)
- Skill Mastery → passive (system removes pressure restriction on routine checks for chosen skill)
- Favored Foe → passive (system applies +2 circumstance when qualifying checks against favored foe occur)

#### Passive vs Active Runtime Analysis (General Advantages — no runtime stories needed)
- Equipment → static (converts to equipment points; no runtime story beyond Equipment module)
- Minion → active during character management (configure, improve, replace); no in-combat advantage runtime story
- Sidekick → active during character management (configure, improve); hero-point proxy story captured
- Benefit → narrative (defined with GM; no runtime application story)

### Power

#### Configure Attack Effect
- **Select Affliction Effect and Configure Condition Set** / **Resolve Affliction Resistance Check and Apply Condition Degree** / **Recover from Affliction Condition at End of Turn**: These three stories form a natural cluster — acquisition, resolution, and recovery. AC must cover: condition set definition at acquisition (exactly 3 conditions in degree order), attack check prerequisite, resistance type choice (Fort vs Will), degree of failure mapping, end-of-turn recovery check, and third-degree special recovery rule (1 minute after effect ends).
- **Select Blast Effect** is mechanically identical to Damage + Ranged extra. AC must confirm the 2 pp/rank cost is already calculated (base 1 + Ranged 1) and that the attack check uses Ranged vs Dodge.
- **Resolve Nullify Opposed Check**: AC must specify both branches — success (effect countered, target can reactivate) and failure (effect continues). Also specify what "countered" means for sustained vs permanent effects.

#### Configure Defense Effect
- **Configure Partial Immunity**: Half-rank immunity costs half the full rank cost. AC must specify that partial immunity reduces the effect rank by half (round down) against the covered effect, not that it provides a bonus.
- **Recover from Death via Immortality**: AC must specify the time-rank formula (19 − Immortality rank) and the edge case at rank 20 (recover at start of each action round).

#### Configure Mobility Effect
- **Select Movement Effect and Choose Special Movement Mode**: Each mode (Dimension Travel, Wall-Crawling, etc.) has sub-rules. AC can parametrize by mode or write per-mode AC. Consolidation note: pass 2 groups all Movement modes under one story; AC phase should expand per mode if distinct behavior is needed.

#### Configure Control Effect
- **Select Create Effect** / **Enforce Created Object Volume and Toughness from Effect Rank** / **Dissolve Created Object**: AC must specify permanence option (spend PP equal to rank).
- **Select Summon Effect** / **Apply Summon Dazed Condition** / **Dismiss Summon**: AC must cover PP = rank × 15, PL ≤ rank, dazed on arrival, directing = move action, and disappearance on incapacitation.

#### Configure General Effect
- **Select Insubstantial Effect**: 4 ranks at 5 pp/rank each — AC must confirm cost per form rank and rules per form (especially rank 4 Incorporeal interaction with physical world).
- **Select Variable Effect**: AC must cover pool size = rank × 5, standard action to reallocate, PL limits on built effects, and pool reset when effect not maintained.

#### Apply Per-Rank Modifiers
- **Enforce Minimum One Point per Rank Floor**: Edge case when flaws reduce cost to fractional — at this point each extra flaw grants ranks at ratio (e.g., 1:2 = 1 pp per 2 ranks). AC must specify the fractional cost progression.

#### Assign Power Descriptors
- **Match Power Descriptor Against Immunity / Nullify**: AC must specify matching logic — descriptors are intentionally flexible (lightning matches electricity); GM is final arbitrator.

#### Organize Power Arrays
- **Add Alternate Effect within Primary Effect Cost Limit**: AC must confirm: (a) total cost including all extras and flaws on the alternate, not just rank × cost, must be ≤ primary; (b) permanent effects cannot be alternates.
- **Reallocate Power Points Among Dynamic Array Effects**: AC must confirm: reallocation once per turn as free action; points not allocated = inactive at that rank; combined allocation cannot exceed total pool.

### Equipment

#### Configure Equipment Pool — Equipment Bonus Non-stacking
Groups the non-stacking rule across all equipment categories (weapons, armor, shields). The rule applies to the same mechanic: only the highest bonus of the same type applies. AC must specify:
- armor bonus capped at highest: wearing two armors gives only the benefit of the better one
- bonus types that do stack (Protection from a device is not equipment bonus — it stacks)
- equipment bonus vs. power bonus vs. circumstance bonus distinction

#### Acquire Weapons — Area Weapons
Grenades and explosives share the Burst/Cloud Area mechanic with a Dodge DC. AC must specify:
- Burst Area: all in range affected, DC 15 resistance check for half
- Cloud Area: lingering, maintains each round
- Grenade vs. explosive: thrown vs. placed/delivered

#### Select Exotic Melee Weapon
Each exotic weapon type has a unique mechanic beyond Strength-based Damage:
- Chain and whip: Reach + Improved Grab + Improved Trip
- Chainsaw: non-Strength-based Damage (fixed damage rank)
- Nunchaku: standard but with specific handling
- Whip: Reach 3 + Improved Grab + Improved Trip (longer reach than chain)
AC for exotic weapons must specify the unique mechanical property, not just the damage.

#### Build Device — Cost Calculations
Removable vs Easily Removable and Indestructible interact on the same device. AC must specify:
- Removable flaw: -1 cost per rank (minimum cost applies)
- Easily Removable flaw: greater reduction (per Powers chapter formula)
- Indestructible: reverses some of the flaw cost reduction
- Combined: Removable + Indestructible is a specific cost point

#### Invent Temporary Device — Time Reduction Trade-off
Reducing design or construction time applies a -5 check penalty per time rank reduced. This same mechanic applies to both normal inventing and ritual performance. AC must specify:
- Time rank table reference for design (hour → 1 hr/pp) and construction (4 hr/pp)
- Jury-rigging bypasses this trade-off entirely (different sub-epic, same hero point currency)

#### Design Vehicle — Shared Feature Pattern with Headquarters
Vehicle features and HQ features both: cost 1 point each, have power effects charged at 1/5 normal. AC for each must confirm the one-fifth cost applies to vehicle/HQ power effects but not to normal equipment items.

#### Build Construct — Zero Net Cost Invariant
The construct traits package (-30 pp from absent abilities + 30 pp Immunity to Fortitude) is neutral. AC must verify the net cost calculation is enforced and that constructs cannot selectively drop only some of the abilities (it is always one pair or the other).

### Combat

#### Execute Attacks
`Make Close Attack Check Against Parry` and `Make Ranged Attack Check Against Dodge` share the same resolution formula (d20 + attack bonus vs. defense class) but differ in which defense is targeted and what range penalties apply. AC must specify both separately with range-penalty details for ranged and the parry-target rule for close.

`Detect Natural 20 as Potential Critical Hit` and `Determine Critical Hit When Total Meets Defense` are two distinct steps in the critical hit determination. AC must specify the two-step check: roll = 20 → automatic hit + threat check → total ≥ defense class → confirmed critical.

`Apply Critical Hit Effect Choice` covers three mutually exclusive options (Increased Effect, Added Effect, Alternate Effect). AC must specify each option separately including the minion bypass rule for Increased Effect and the no-fatigue rule for Alternate Effect.

`Bypass Attack Check for Area or Perception Effect` negates all attack-check modifiers (concealment, cover, maneuvers, aim bonus). AC must confirm that area and perception effects automatically hit and cannot crit or miss.

#### Perform Combat Maneuvers
`Execute Grab Attempt` and `Resolve Grab Resistance Check` are sequential — AC for the grab story must cover both the attack check and the resistance check against Strength or Dodge.

`Maintain Grab Hold as Free Action` and `Damage Grabbed Target on Subsequent Turn` are separate stories with separate AC: maintaining a hold (free action, attacker hindered+vulnerable) vs. choosing to deal damage (standard action, only after hold established on a prior turn).

`Escape from Grab` uses Athletics or Acrobatics vs. routine check result of opponent's Strength or grab rank — this is a move action, separate AC needed to distinguish from the grab's resistance check.

`Counter-Disarm as Reaction` and `Counter-Trip as Reaction` only trigger when specific conditions are met (melee disarm lost; trip check lost) — AC must specify the triggering precondition.

#### Resolve Damage and Recovery
`Apply Damage Condition by Degree of Failure` covers four degrees with different outcomes:
- 1 degree: −1 cumulative Toughness penalty (no condition change)
- 2 degrees: dazed + −1 penalty
- 3 degrees: staggered + −1 penalty (if already staggered → 4th degree)
- 4 degrees: incapacitated

`Recover from Damage in Conflict` (standard action, once per conflict) vs. `Remove Damage Condition After Rest` (automatic, 1 condition per minute) are distinct recovery paths. AC must specify once-per-conflict constraint and the +2 defense bonus granted by Recover action.

`Resolve Ongoing Effect Resistance Check at End of Turn` is automatic — no action required. AC must specify that success ends the effect and removes its conditions; failure leaves conditions in place.

#### Use Hero Resources
`Spend Hero Point to Re-Roll Die` has the special floor rule: re-roll of 1–10 adds 10, making the floor 11. AC must specify the must-spend-before-GM-announces constraint.

`Spend Hero Point for Heroic Feat Advantage` excludes fortune advantages and requires meeting prerequisites. AC must specify these constraints.

`Declare Extra Effort for Combat Benefit` covers eight benefit options — AC must specify each as a distinct variant with the once-per-turn constraint and the fatigue cost.

`Activate Power Stunt via Extra Effort` requires an existing power as the base; permanent effects excluded; lasts until end of scene. AC must specify the base-power requirement and scene-duration rule.

`Spend Hero Point to Remove Extra Effort Fatigue` must be spent at the START of the turn after extra effort — not immediately after. AC must specify the timing constraint.


## Context Gaps

### Resolve Checks
- No GM-facing campaign/adventure management context in source — scope is hero and rules mechanics only.
- Construct behavior at runtime (animated objects, robots acting independently) — source describes stats and commanding but runtime autonomy is unclear for an online tool.
- Condition-specific recovery triggers (entranced broken by obvious threat or ally interaction check DC 10 + effect rank; asleep broken by hearing Perception check 3+ degrees or shaking) — mapped as general recovery; AC phase must specify per-condition recovery paths.
- Condition enforcement across modules: conditions define game modifiers (action restrictions, check penalties, defense reductions) but enforcement lives in consuming modules (Combat for action limits, Check for check penalties). Cross-module wiring not yet mapped as stories.

### Character
- Complication activation during play (GM introduces complication, player goes along, earns hero point) is a runtime behavior owned by the Check module — not represented in this construction map.
- Online tool persistence and versioning of hero sheets is outside the source scope; no stories mapped.
- Team/party construction coordination (ensuring heroes complement each other) is addressed informally in source ("consult fellow players") with no formal construction steps — not mapped.
- Quickstart Character Generator (page 54 reference) is mentioned in source as an alternative to full hero design; scope and mechanic not described in available chunks — flagged as context gap.

### Ability
- **GM authorization workflow for absent abilities**: Source requires GM permission for heroes to lack an ability but does not specify whether an online tool prompts for approval, logs a flag, or blocks the action outright — UX and workflow decision needed.
- **Enhanced ability nullification interaction**: When an enhanced ability rank is nullified, the base (natural) portion of the rank should remain — the exact system behavior for partial nullification (which portion is reduced and in what order) requires clarification from the Power module.
- **Debilitation recovery source**: The specific game effect (power, healing, time) that restores a debilitated ability rank is owned by the module that caused the debilitation — the Ability module detects when rank recovers to ≥ −5 and clears the debilitated state, but does not itself initiate the recovery.
- **Defense class display vs. calculation separation**: Whether the online tool derives and displays defense class (Dodge + 10 etc.) as a separate computed field on the character sheet, or only exposes raw defense ranks, is a UI/product decision.

### Skill
- **Skill Mastery full definition**: The Skill Mastery advantage definition lives in the Advantages chapter, not Chapter 4. Source chunks confirm it allows routine check results even under stress but do not specify all edge cases (e.g., when exactly a roll is "required" vs. voluntary).
- **Technology Inventing**: The Inventing use of Technology (with Inventor advantage) references page 211 of the source, outside these chunks. The story "Build Technological Item" covers standard building; Inventing creates temporary devices with advantages/powers but the mechanics are not in scope here.
- **Vehicles animal-mount gap**: The Vehicles skill explicitly excludes animal mounts; Expertise: Riding is the correct skill. The GM may allow Athletics with a circumstance penalty. This decision is GM-adjudicated and not source-specified further.
- **Interaction skill group use mechanics**: The source states the GM decides if group use is effective and may apply modifiers depending on the situation; specific group resistance mechanics are not fully specified beyond the minion example.
- **Perception sense types**: All sense types defined in the Powers chapter are valid for Perception checks; the detailed list and modifiers are out of scope here.

### Advantage
- Favored Environment auto-detection: whether the online tool tracks environmental context (air, water, space, etc.) automatically or requires the player to manually declare "I am in my favored environment" at the start of a round is not specified in the source — affects whether the Declare story is player-driven or system-driven.
- Benefit storage: Benefit is cooperatively defined between player and GM with no mechanical formula; the online tool likely needs a free-text narrative field, but the interface for GM approval/rejection of benefit text is not specified.
- Minion and Sidekick as full characters: whether the online tool creates a full character sheet for minions and sidekicks (with the ability to apply conditions, track damage, etc.) or represents them as simplified stat blocks is not specified — affects the depth of the Configure Minion and Configure Sidekick stories.

### Power
- **Morph effect**: Referenced in source chunks (chunk_121) as a distinct named effect but not included in the module partition's core terms list. Potentially belongs in this module or a separate "Form Change" module.
- **Mind Control**: Referenced in source (chunk_120) as a significant effect but not in the partition's core terms. May be in scope — partition may under-represent Affliction-based control.
- **Mental Blast**: Referenced in source (chunk_117). May be Damage (Perception range) preconfiguration — not in partition.
- **Extra Limbs**: Referenced in source (chunk_104). Not in partition core terms — may be a Feature instance rather than a standalone effect.
- **Element Control and Energy Control**: Referenced in source (chunks 100, 103) as power families rather than individual effects. Not in partition — context only.
- **Force Field**: Referenced in source (chunk_107) as a named configuration (Protection + Sustained extra). Not in partition.
- **Full Extras/Flaws catalog**: Only the 8 most common extras and flaws are in the partition. The full catalog includes Increased Duration, Extended Range, Increased Action, Secondary Effect, Variable Descriptor, Side Effect, and many others. AC phase should note these as out-of-scope for MVP but available via the Modifier KA pattern.
- **Routine effect checks**: Chunk_086 covers routine use of effects. Not mapped as a story — may need a story under Configure Attack Effect or Configure General Effect if the application builds an "auto-resolve" feature.
- **Countering effects**: Chunk_088 (N-W table section) mentions countering in the same section as power effect summaries. Countering as a combat mechanic (not Nullify) may need a story under Combat module.

### Equipment
- Construct size variation: the source says constructs larger/smaller than Medium pay power points for Innate/Permanent Growth or Shrinking, but does not specify when/how the GM adjudicates this in the application — flagged for GM-tools phase.
- Alternate Equipment hero-point stunt: the GM rules whether having an item "on-hand" is possible. The decision criteria are unspecified in source — AC should note this is GM discretion, not a system-enforced rule.
- Vehicle multi-mode movement: the source states Alternate Effects for multiple movement modes but does not specify how the application handles mode switching in play — may require combat sub-system integration.
- Ritual mishap details: 3+ degrees of failure on a ritual research check "may result in a mishap" but no mishap table or severity rules are given in the equipment chapter (cross-reference to GM section needed).
- Team equipment point pooling enforcement: the source says teams may divide cost "however they wish, usually as evenly as possible" — no system enforcement described; AC must treat this as player/GM agreement, not enforced limit.

### Combat
- Maneuver interaction with power effects: when a power effect duplicates a maneuver (e.g., a Snare effect that restrains like a grab), the interaction between the power effect's resistance check and the maneuver's resolution chain is not fully specified in the source. Flag for AC phase.
- Area effect concealment/cover interaction: source states area/perception effects bypass attack checks, but the cover bonus to Dodge resistance checks against area effects (equal to cover penalty to attacks) introduces a residual concealment question — does concealment from dim light also grant any Dodge bonus vs. area effects? Source does not specify.
- Finishing Attack against defenseless targets: the Finishing Attack maneuver (routine check or normal check for auto-crit) is referenced in the feint/defending objects chunks but not listed as its own story; it is implicit in attacking defenseless targets. AC phase should cover it under `Attack or Smash Object` and `Defend` stories.
- Recover action and extra effort interaction: a character can use extra effort to gain an additional resistance check (separate from the Recover action's additional check); whether both can be used in the same turn is not explicitly stated. Assumed yes — extra effort is a free action before or after the Recover action.
- Initiative for characters with the same Dodge and Agility after two tie-breaker steps: source says "each tied player should roll a die" but an application must decide how to handle GM-controlled NPCs in this scenario.
